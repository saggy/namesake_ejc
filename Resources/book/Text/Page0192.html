    	 <p class="Body" i="13">Whatever He was writing on the ground that day, Jesus was a man of few words in this story. Many rabbis might have taken the opportunity to give a treatise on the laws. Rabbis (both past and present) have filled whole books with teachings expounding on just one law. Jesus could have given a lengthy lecture, either to the accusers or to the accused. He chose, instead, to speak only two brief responses. Let’s look at the first of those.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="14"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="15"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="16">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('John.8.7')" i="17">John 8:7</span> and fill in the blanks:</span></p>

      <p class="Body" i="18"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="19"><span class="char-style-override-23" i="20">“If any one of you is <span correctanswer="none" question="“If any one of you is ­­­­___________ ________, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.”" id="bf21" onclick="blankfill(this)" class="blankfill" i="21" style="min-width: 12em; "></span>, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.”</span> <span class="char-style-override-21" i="22">(NIV)</span></p>

      <p class="Body" i="23"></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="24">The accusers in this story were on the attack, advancing in their moral assault of this woman and closing in on Jesus with an ethical trap, but Jesus, with just one sentence, stopped them in their tracks. Instead of looking at the sins of others, He told them, take a look inside yourself. The question was not <span class="char-style-override-17" i="25">What sin do you find in her?</span> but <span class="char-style-override-17" i="26">What sin do you find in your own heart?</span></p>

      <p class="Body" i="27">When these men, so bold in their accusations, turned their judging eyes on themselves, they became all too aware that none of them (and none of us, for that matter) lives up to the standard of sinlessness Jesus was holding up here. The only one in that crowd who was without sin was the One offering that challenge, and He wasn’t picking up any stones.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="28">Jesus didn’t condemn the sinner standing before him. He didn’t even condemn the other sinners standing there. He had patience and compassion for both the accused and&nbsp;her accusers.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="29">“He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.8.7')" i="30">John 8:7</span> WEB). I don’t have statistics to prove it, but it’s my bet that this is one of the most well-known verses in the Bible. I’ve even heard it quoted by people who don’t know much about the Bible at all. They use it to defend themselves when they feel someone is judging them. I’m afraid they also quote it because they feel they have to defend themselves against Christians.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="31">Though we don’t pick up rocks to throw at people who have done wrong, we do hurl critical words. We fling disapproving looks. We lob rumors and gossip, even when they are disguised as concern or even as prayer requests.</p>
