        <p class="Body">Naomi’s realization that God was working for good on her behalf was a
          turning point for her. She stopped focusing on the negative past and began to work for
          positive change for a future for her and Ruth.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20">In yesterday’s reading we saw how Ruth recognized
          that if she wanted something to change, she would have to take action. Today we see that
          all along God has been acting and working behind the scenes. Those two things together are
          often a recipe for miracles in our lives. We need both God’s powerful action in our lives
          and our own initiative, joining with Him to work for good. Depending on one or the other
          ignores the fact that God so clearly wants to work in partnership with us in this world.
          He is at work for our good, and He wants us to join Him.</p>
