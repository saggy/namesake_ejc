The first eleven chapters of the Bible are a depiction of how quickly the world goes downhill when we begin to worship our own misguided desires and put ourselves first.</p>

    <p class="Body">The story starts off in such a beautiful setting, with perfect relationships, a perfect environment, and a God whose presence and love are palpable. Eden is a place where God and human beings know and are known without any barriers. But all of that quickly changes as human choices invite disaster after disaster. The downward spiral culminates in chapter 11 of Genesis, aptly numbered since it is truly about the moral bankruptcy of the world. The collective people of the world gather in chapter 11 and work toward a common, selfish goal.</p>

    <p class="Body">Notice that their purpose in building the tower was to make a name for themselves.</p>

    <p class="Body">Lifting up their own name implied that they were trusting in their own strength and striving for their own fame and success. They were physically reaching for godlike status. Anytime we put ourselves first, declaring that we can live without God’s help or guidance, we are putting ourselves in the place that belongs to God. And that always spells trouble.</p>

    <p class="Body">We often refer to the resulting story as the Tower of Babel. The crashing down of the physical tower is mirrored in the chaos of human relationships and communication. The world as they knew it was in shambles. But the very next chapter provides a deep contrast. Abraham and Sarah are builders, too, but while the people of Babel built a tower and lifted up their own name, Abraham and Sarah built an altar and called on the name of the Lord.</p>

    <p class="Body">Their first encounter with God in chapter 12 has Abraham and Sarah humbled and in awe of the greatest power in the universe. Their response to hearing the life-changing promises that are to come is to build an altar and call on the name of the Lord.</p>
