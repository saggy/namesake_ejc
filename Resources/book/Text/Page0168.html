      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">• Is there someone in your community who is branded by an act he or she participated in that hurt one person or a group of people? Maybe it’s someone you know personally who is still struggling to forgive himself or herself, or someone you’ve only read about or heard about that has caused pain to others. Commit to pray for the person this week. If it seems appropriate, find a way to reach out and extend grace, even if it’s just a quick “hello.”</p>
