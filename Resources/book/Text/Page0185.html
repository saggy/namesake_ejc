    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">was, on the surface, a decision about the sentencing of a woman caught breaking her marriage covenant. Her destiny was in His hands. And as we saw yesterday, the decision He would make also would determine His own fate.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">A decision to uphold the law of Moses would have half the crowd cheering and marching out into the street, filling their pockets with stones to begin an execution. But the Roman authorities, already leery of this man who could draw a crowd with His borderline revolutionary teaching, would most likely retaliate. A decision to have mercy and pardon her would have some in the crowd admiring His compassion, but the Pharisees would declare that He didn’t really follow the laws of the Torah and wasn’t a true man of God.</p>

      <p class="Body">Rock. Hard place. Jesus in between.</p>

      <p class="Body">You can bet that the crowd got quiet as they waited for Jesus’ decision. The accusers who had dragged the woman before Jesus fell silent as they waited to see what He would do. One particular person listened with a special intensity, straining to hear the words that would come from this man’s lips. Although a group of men had dragged her into this predicament, it was now just one man who would determine whether she lived or died. All eyes were on Jesus. But Jesus wasn’t looking back at any of them. Let’s pick up the story at this point.</p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('John.8.6')">John 8:6</span>. What was Jesus doing?</span></p>

       	  <div class="answer" id="p185la1" onclick="answer(this)" question="Reread John 8:6. What was Jesus doing?"></div>

      <p class="Body">He was looking at the ground. And while they watched, “Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.8.6')">John 8:6</span>). This made them all even more curious. What was He writing? The text doesn’t tell us.</p>

      <p class="Body">The Greek verb used for <span class="char-style-override-17">write</span> is <span class="char-style-override-17">kategraphen</span>—indicating more than just doodling or drawing. It specifies that Jesus was writing words. Scholars who have studied this text have guessed, discussed, and guessed some more about what Jesus was writing on the ground.</p>

      <p class="Body">Maybe He was writing out a list of the Ten Commandments or the sins of her accusers—so that they would recognize that none of them was above reproach. Maybe Jesus was writing out all the names of the men there who were also guilty of adultery. One particular guess I like is that Jesus might have been writing her name. He might have been humanizing this unknown woman, the one they had reduced to her sin, the one who was a pawn in their plot, the one whose life was at risk because they dragged her into the Temple to her own death-sentence trial.</p>

      <p class="Body">If Jesus was writing her identity in the sand that day, those men accusing her would have had a hard time seeing her as an unnamed object. The One who created her and loved her was naming her before them to say, <span class="char-style-override-17">This is not a mere creature. She is more than her sin. She is more than her mistakes. She has a name.</span></p>
