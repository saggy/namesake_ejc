        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">uncle and their four kids to arrive. The
          phone rang. My mom answered it, and I could tell it was her brother on the other line. I
          remember wondering why they were running late. Then I heard my mom say, “Oh, no. Oh, no,”
          over and over again. And then finally: “Oh, I’m so sorry.” My uncle and his family had
          arrived at their home to find their oldest son had taken his own life. He was just twenty
          years old.</p>

        <p class="Body">Time stopped for me in those few seconds after the phone rang. I can
          remember with odd clarity the tiny details of the room, the ache and shock that I felt,
          and the immediate concern for my ninety-year-old grandmother, whom we’d break the news to
          within minutes. Our family faced a very different kind of Christmas that year, one with
          grief as a centerpiece, overshadowing all the plans we had made.</p>

        <p class="Body">We often use the words “family members” to describe those who are related to
          us. The term <span class="char-style-override-17">members</span> is also used to describe
          the parts of our body; arms and legs are members of a whole. When one member is badly hurt
          or even removed, the whole body goes into a kind of shock, feeling the pain of dis<span
            class="char-style-override-17">member</span>ment. The same is true when those we love
          are taken away. Then shock and numbness give way to overwhelming pain.</p>

        <p class="Body">Naomi’s life was torn apart when she lost everything she knew and loved. In
          the very first verse of the book of Ruth we learn that her homeland was rocked by such
          severe famine that her family was forced to evacuate, becoming refugees in the neighboring
          country Moab. The first loss Naomi experiences is the loss of her livelihood—her own
          sustenance and her ability to feed her family. This led to the loss of her home, her
          friends, and the familiarity of all that she knew as she and her husband fled to another
          country with their two boys just to survive.</p>

        <p class="Body">If these were Naomi’s only losses we would feel sorry for her, but they were
          nothing compared to the losses yet to come.</p>

        <p class="Body">All in a few verses Naomi loses the three most important people in her
          life—her husband and two sons. Her family is dismembered, torn apart.</p>

        <p class="Body">How does Naomi react? Not surprisingly, she is grief-stricken, bitter, and
          angry at God. Her daughters-in-law are loyal to her and want to stay with her, even though
          they are grieving the losses of their own husbands. We’ll learn more about their reactions
          tomorrow, but even with their attempts to comfort her, Naomi’s reaction shows us how alone
          and dejected she feels.</p>

        <p class="Body">After she returns to Bethlehem, the women in the town are so surprised to
          see Naomi again. They exclaim, “Can this be Naomi?” Naomi’s response speaks volumes about
          her emotional state:</p>
