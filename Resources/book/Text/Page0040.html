        <p style="text-align: justify;">When I stepped off the plane in India, the sights I encountered took my 
breath away. The colors around me were vibrant, the smells intense, the heat, a 
sweltering 110 degrees. The poverty I witnessed was far beyond anything I had 
seen or imagined. Immense crowds of people clothed in dirt and rags, animals 
competing with beggars for scraps in the street, and the children—huge black 
eyes, unruly hair, mouths twitching at the corner as if they wished they could 
share a smile—they seemed to follow us everywhere we went. So many of them 
were begging on the streets, surrounding our mission group whenever we left 
the hotel and walking with us, holding out their hands. We were warned over 
and over not to give them anything because it would only draw more of a crowd, 
but my heart broke every time I saw their dirty, upturned palms.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A year later I came across an article online that brought that experience rushing back. 
        	The phrase “renaming ceremony” caught my eye in the headline, and 
because of my interest in names, I clicked on it and found pictures of faces just 
like the ones I remembered on the Indian streets.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The girls in the picture were lined up and dressed in their best, all 285 of them 
sharing the same name: Nakusa. This name, which is a popular one given to girls 
in India, means “Unwanted.” In families overwhelmed by poverty, the birth of a 
daughter is seen as a burden, not a blessing. She’s unwanted, and she hears that 
fact spoken aloud every time someone calls her by name. In the district where 
these girls live, there are only 881 girls for every 1,000 boys, a difference brought 
about by gender-selective abortions and neglect of baby girls to the point of 
death. Being unwanted is a life-threatening condition.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Concerned about the dangers facing young girls in their district, 
        	the government began furnishing free meals and education to families with girls. They even 
provided cash bonuses for families with girls who graduated from high school, a 
rare event in an area where education is usually reserved for boys. To take away </p>
