        <p class="Body">The phrase “I will build” means that Jesus was willing to call someone who
          was a work in progress, someone on whom He could build a vision, a foundation for the
          future of His church. Jesus is claiming Simon because he was great building material, not
          because he was a finished product.</p>

        <p class="Body">The reasons God is attracted to us as followers—the magnetic pull to do
          everything in His power to make us one of His own—has nothing to do with anything we’ve
          already built ourselves up to be. It has everything to do with His unconditional love for
          us just as we are.</p>

              5:6</span>-8. When did God commit the ultimate act of love for us, and what does that
            prove?</span>

        <p class="Body">The most muddled personality in Jesus’ hands is worth more in the kingdom of
          God than the person who seems to have it all together but denies God access and authority
          in her or his life. Peter is living proof of that!</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Aren’t you glad God calls us just the way we are? If
          He waited for us to become perfect in order to qualify us for His band of followers, He
          would be waiting forever. We simply don’t have the ability to make ourselves good enough
          for God, so God comes to us where we are. He scoops us up as if we were a rare and
          precious asset, while those around us shake their heads wondering what He sees in us. Amid
          the world’s choruses of “That one will never be a saint!” God enjoys proving them
          wrong.</p>

          <span class="char-style-override-17">Jesus, we are so grateful that You aren’t looking for
            perfection. Thank You that You love us just the way we are, and that You choose us to
            follow You not because of our own efforts but because of Your deep and unconditional
            love for us. We offer ourselves to You as raw material. Build on our flaws until they
            become strengths. Make us leaders so that more people can follow You and experience Your
            grace. Amen.</span>
