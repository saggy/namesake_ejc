        <p class="Body" id="p56p6" i="27">Favoritism is the notion that in order to give a fuller measure of love to
          one person, we must neglect or deprive another. Judging from their actions, both Rebekah
          and Isaac believed this to be true, and they could not have been more wrong.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p56p7" i="28">Of all the commodities that families provide one another—shelter, food,
          quality time, love—love is the one resource that isn’t ever limited or scarce. When we
          share love, affection, and approval with another person, our storehouse is not depleted
          but multiplied.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p56p8" i="29">Families are sometimes programmed to act with a sense of scarcity, as if we
          have to choose who receives love and praise and blessing because they are in short supply.
          Our lack of contentment is often rooted in the feeling that we weren’t given enough by our
          families of origin—enough love, praise, or attention.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p56p9" i="30">The heart-wrenching final scene in this story is a picture of a son begging
          for approval and blessing, while a father believes there’s no more to offer because he has
          already given it all away to the wrong son. Scarcity is the controlling idea on his side
          of the parenting equation, as well as his wife’s.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p56p13" i="39">The good news is that God never operates according to the principle of
          scarcity. He is never limited in how many prayers He can answer or how much love He can
          pour out. Just because God loves and blesses one of His children doesn’t mean He can’t
          love and bless all the others. In fact, He knows specifically how<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="40"></p>
