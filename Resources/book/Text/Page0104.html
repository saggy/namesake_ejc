        <p class="Body" i="13">In each story the stakes get higher, from 1 in 100, to 1 in 10, to 1 in 2.
          With each story the item lost and found gets more valuable: a sheep, a coin, and then a
          son, treasured from birth, given a name and a home and a family to belong to.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="14">The third story is the best known and is often called the story of the
          Prodigal Son. It clearly shows God’s heart as a Father aching for His children to be safe
          at home in close and loving relationship with Him. God is whispering to us that we are the
          most valuable thing in His kingdom, more valuable than a sheep or a coin; we are His
          children, His daughters.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="15">In these three stories, God is showing us a Redeemer who stops at nothing to
          find what is lost. And He’s saying: That’s me! I’m the Shepherd. I’m the Coin-owner. I’m
          the Father. And you are the ones I seek. I will stop at nothing until you are found,
          redeemed, and returned home, safe and sound with me.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="16">The romance in the book of Ruth is another story with a hidden hero. The
          true Redeemer peeks from behind the scenes, waiting to see if we can find Him whispering
          an invitation through the story. Transfixed by the happy marriage of Boaz and Ruth, we
          just might find ourselves caught up in our own love story, one with the Kinsman-Redeemer,
          who is at work to claim what is lost. He will not stop until we are found.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="17">Let’s take a closer look at how God is our Kinsman-Redeemer, our <span class="char-style-override-17" i="18">Go’el</span>.</p>
