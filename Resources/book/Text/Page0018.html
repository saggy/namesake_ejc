    	 <p class="noindentp" style="text-align: justify;" id="p18p1">him instantly. The wake-up call was immediate. In the midst of grief, confession, 
and repentance, Jeff gave his life to Jesus and pledged to go into ministry, telling 
his story to prevent others from going down the wrong path.</p><p id="p18p2">
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" id="p18p3">Our teens loved the drama of Jeff’s testimony and the real transformation 
they saw in him. Each time he told his story, a handful of them realized they were 
on the same path of rebellion and made a dramatic turn with their own lives.</p><p id="p18p4">	
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" id="p18p5">But then there were the rest of the kids—regular churchgoers living less than 
dramatic lives. Many of them had already given their lives to Christ. Most could 
not identify with the remarkable circumstances of Jeff’s life. When asked to tell 
about how God was working in their lives, some of them lamented, “I don’t 
really have a testimony. God hasn’t done much in my life compared to Jeff.” 
They didn’t realize that they were being daily transformed in little ways, or that 
it was important to expect God’s help with the smallest things. Turning their 
temptations toward greed, lust, selfishness, and materialism (to name a few) 
over to God, bit by bit, was forming a dramatically different future for them. 
They were&nbsp;becoming new and different people, but sometimes the alterations 
were almost too small to see.</p><p id="p18p6">	
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" id="p18p7">In light of the big changes God wanted to make in Abram and Sarai’s lives, 
the changes in their names seem so small. In fact, it was just one Hebrew letter 
each. But when God makes changes, the tiniest adjustment can communicate big 
things for us, our futures, and those whose lives we will impact.</p><p id="p18p8">
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" id="p18p9">Abram and Sarai each received the same letter as an addition to their names. In 
Hebrew the letter is called “Hey” (similar to our “H”). Abram became Abraham 
and Sarai became Sarah.</p><p id="p18p10">
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" id="p18p11">In Hebrew, letters have significance beyond just a pronounced sound. Each 
character of the Hebrew alphabet is infused with meaning. The letter Hey, for 
example, also signifies the number five, since it’s the fifth letter of the Hebrew 
alphabet. Hey sometimes represents the divine breath, revelation, and light.&nbsp;In 
some Jewish teachings, Hey is a picture of the presence of God within the human 
heart. Adding Hey at the very end of a Hebrew noun gives the word a feminine 
character, which can metaphorically mean the word has become “fruitful” or 
reproductive.</p><p id="p18p12">
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" id="p18p13">What did the addition of that one letter mean to Abraham and Sarah? It shifted the meaning of their names to fit God’s plan for their future. Abram, which 
means “The Exalted Father,” was now Abraham, which means “The Father of Many Nations.” </p><p id="p18p14">

No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made

you, and kings will come from you.”</li>
