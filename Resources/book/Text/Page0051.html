        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p51p2" i="18">As we learn to treat others with respect and honor,
          it’s important that we not disrespect ourselves in the process. The commandment to “Love
          your neighbor as yourself” comes with the implication that we <span class="char-style-override-17" i="19">first</span> must be able to love ourselves without
          reservation. If we cannot, the step of loving our neighbor will always be tainted with
          neediness and self-interest. But if we love and serve others in an overflow of
          self-respect and acceptance, we will offer ourselves out of an understanding of God’s love
          for us. Once we understand our own worth in Christ, it is easy to want others to feel
          special and valued in the same way.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p51p13" i="49">As twins, Jacob and Esau had the closest possible of human connections. They
          also had the greatest temptation toward competition and contempt. The closer we are to the
          people in our lives, the more our familiarity can tempt us to treat them with disrespect.
          At the same time, our closeness can help us discover the amazing gifts God places in each
          individual. The relationships that are part of your everyday life have the potential to
          make you a jealous Jacob, or you can choose to celebrate the gift of your close
          relationships and the handiwork of God you find there. Ask God to help you to see the
          masterpieces He has created in others and praise Him for the hidden gifts they bring to
          your life.</p>
