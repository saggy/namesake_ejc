    <p class="Body">Each of us starts out in life with a family of origin, the family that we are born into and raised in. We end up in life in a family of destination, the family we may marry into, give birth to, or end up living with as adults. There is another kind of family called a family choice. These are people who may have no blood relation to us but may become as close as or closer than family. This kind of friendship can bring us some of the greatest joy and comfort we will ever experience in life.</p>

    <p class="Body">Ruth made an alliance of friendship with Naomi that went beyond their bloodlines. She chose to reject ties with family members in order to support and protect a friend. Covenant friendship often runs deeper than ties with relatives.</p>

    <p class="Body">One of God’s greatest gifts to us is the gift of friendship. Through our friends, we receive God’s love, kindness, laughter, and grace through a human delivery system. As you reflect on the friendships you’ve treasured in life, remember the source, the Giver of all good gifts.</p>
