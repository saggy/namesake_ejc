          are born into and raised in. We end up in life in a family of destination, the family we
          may marry into, give birth to, or end up living with as adults. There is another kind of
          family called a family choice. These are people who may have no blood relation to us but
          may become as close as or closer than family. This kind of friendship can bring us some of
          the greatest joy and comfort we will ever experience in life.</p>
