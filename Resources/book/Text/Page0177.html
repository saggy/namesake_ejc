girls!” But her name also speaks of a family with more than enough: enough 
love and fun and laughter to go around. Nuffy, as they called her, grew up with 
a lovely smile and a mischievous personality, enjoying the love and attention of 
her big sisters.</p><p i="14">
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" i="15">When people hear her name and her story, they often respond with shock 
and surprise and ask if she is serious. They can’t believe that parents would 
give their little girl the name Enuf. But Nuffy loves having a name that no one 
else has. When asked how she feels about her name, Nuffy says, “Because my 
name creates a spotlight for me, all of a sudden this five-foot-three-inch girl with 
a big smile is not dismissed as just another sweetheart or pushover. My name 
gives me a voice . . . and I’m going to make the most out this blessing. I love 
reaching people, brightening their days, making an impression. No one else has 
an opportunity to spread God’s story and be remembered like I do.”</p><p i="16">

to our study. This week we’ll discover the story of a woman who was named by 
her past, and whose legacy is different than that of the other individuals we’ve 
studied because it is shaped by her lack of a name. Through her, we’ll find that 
God’s grace is enough—enough to reshape our lives after a rocky start; enough 
to change our stories and our names forever.</p><p i="20">
