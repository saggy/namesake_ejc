    <p class="Body" id="p67p10" i="37">In Hebrew the name “I <span style="font-variant: small-caps;" i="38">am</span>” is made up of four consonants: YHWH. This ancient name for God is known as the <span class="char-style-override-17" i="39">tetragrammaton</span>, and it is derived from a verb meaning “to be.”</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p67p14" i="47">Because of the understanding that to speak the name of someone aloud was to try to exert a measure of power or control over him or her, they regarded God’s name, YHWH, as too sacred to pronounce.
