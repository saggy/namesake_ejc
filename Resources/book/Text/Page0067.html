    <p class="Body" id="p67p10">In Hebrew the name “I <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">am</span>” is made up of four consonants: YHWH. This ancient name for God is known as the <span class="char-style-override-17">tetragrammaton</span>, and it is derived from a verb meaning “to be.”</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p67p13"><span>A word made up entirely of consonants is unpronounceable. Try saying jxtpstn or schtlgy out loud!</span> God’s people needed a way to address Him, a way to speak the unspeakable YHWH. But they were afraid. They didn’t want to mistakenly pull a “Jacob,” trying to make a power play toward God by grabbing hold of His name. They were afraid of addressing God with too much familiarity.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p67p14">Because of the understanding that to speak the name of someone aloud was to try to exert a measure of power or control over him or her, they regarded God’s name, YHWH, as too sacred to pronounce. They took the&nbsp;instruction of <span onclick="biblepop('Lev.24.16')">Leviticus 24:16</span>, “Anyone who blasphemes the name of&nbsp;YHWH must be put to death,” so seriously that they went&nbsp;a step further by implying that anyone who even <span class="char-style-override-17">pronounced</span> the name of YHWH aloud would be in deep trouble. God never said that was the case, but they figured that when dealing with the Holy One, it was better to be safe than sorry.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p67p15"><span>To avoid pronouncing God’s name aloud, God’s people deliberately took the consonants God gave Moses and added the vowels from another word. So, they</span> <span>took the name YHWH, I</span> <span class="char-style-override-14">am</span><span>, and added the vowels from another title for God, Adonai, which means “My Lord.” Mixed together, these are pronounced</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Yahweh</span> <span>or</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Jehovah</span><span>.
