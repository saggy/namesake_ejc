    	 <p class="Body para-style-override-20">When Jesus was eight days old, His parents took him to His first religious ceremony, the first of many that He would attend in His lifetime as an observant Jew. But this one was personal. This is where He received His name. The mortality rate for infants in childbirth and shortly after was so great that parents held off giving their boy babies an official name until their circumcision ceremony on their eighth day.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="Body">When it came time for Mary and Joseph to announce their tiny baby’s name before God and everyone at this ceremony, the name they spoke was probably a shock to many. Some may have even wondered if they made a mistake.</p>

      <p class="Body">“His name is Jesus.”</p>

      <p class="Body">To those in attendance, this would have been surprising because traditionally firstborn sons were named after their fathers. One reason we know about this custom is that Jesus’ slightly older cousin was also given a surprising name.</p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read <span onclick="biblepop('Luke.1.57')">Luke 1:57</span>-66. What did those participating in this child’s circumcision and naming ceremony want to name him? Why? What name did he receive?</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body">When we read the story of Jesus’ naming, we have the benefit of two pieces of information that most people who were there that day probably did not know. First, we know that Jesus’ name was decided before His birth or circumcision day and wasn’t chosen by his parents.</p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">In <span onclick="biblepop('Matt.1.20')">Matthew 1:20</span>-21, who receives news of Jesus’ name? Who announces that news? Why is He to be named Jesus?</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">In <span onclick="biblepop('Luke.1.26')">Luke 1:26</span>-33, who receives news of Jesus’ name? Who announces that news? What else is predicted about Jesus?</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body">Second, we know that despite what people might have expected, Jesus <span class="char-style-override-17">was</span> given a first name that reflected His father’s identity. It wasn’t the name of His earthly adopted father, Joseph, but a name that reflected the character of His Father in heaven.</p>

      <p class="Body">Let’s look at where Jesus’ name originated. In Numbers 13, God commanded Moses to send twelve spies into the land of Canaan to see how fruitful it was</p>
