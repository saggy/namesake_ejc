        <p class="Body">Soon after God’s life-changing and name-changing meeting with Jacob, He
          began to identify Himself as “The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” This is an amazing
          occurrence, so don’t miss the implications. The Holy God who created the universe began to
          introduce Himself by naming the names of His people!</p>

        <p class="Body">It’s as if God is saying, “If you want to know who I <span
            class="char-style-override-14">am</span>, check out what I did in the lives of these
          people. The changes I’ve accomplished there will show you my power, my grace, my attentive
          care to their smallest and greatest needs.” The changes in their lives authenticated the
          character of God, so God began to point them out as His signature. God is claiming that He
          is best known through His handiwork—and that we are His most significant handiwork!</p>

        <p class="Body">When I think of the fact that God wants to show His character to the world
          through me, that He wants to be able to call Himself “The God of Jessica” and know that
          people will recognize His character in my life, it brings a whole new significance to my
          longing to be more like Him. I want to be sure that people see God clearly in me so that I
          can be His namesake, carrying His name in a way that will make Him proud.</p>

          <span class="char-style-override-21">If God were to point to your story as one that He had
            touched, what evidence would there be? What aspects of your life bear God’s
            fingerprints, showing the world that He has been at work?</span>

        <p class="Body">Revelation, revealing who He is, is one of God’s specialties. If we long to
          know who God is at His very core, we’ll do well to pick up our end of the line and listen
          carefully to His voice. God speaks His name daily into our lives in a thousand different
          ways, not the least of which is through the work He does in you and me.</p>

        <p class="Body">Look back at the times in your life when you wondered if you could trust
          God. What was the outcome? Take time to talk to God about the times when you’ve struggled
          to trust Him. Spend time specifically praising Him for His unchanging nature (I <span
            class="char-style-override-14">am</span>) and for His actions that have blessed your
          life (I will).</p>
