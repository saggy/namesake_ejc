Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before.</span> <span class="text-dan-6-11 char-style-override-18" i="33">11</span><span class="text-dan-6-11 char-style-override-17" i="34">&nbsp;Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help.</span> <span class="text-dan-6-12 char-style-override-18" i="35">12</span><span class="text-dan-6-12 char-style-override-17" i="36">&nbsp;So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you, O king, would be thrown into the lions’ den?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-24" i="37"><span class="text-dan-6-12 char-style-override-17" i="38">The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”</span></p>
