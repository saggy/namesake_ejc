        <p class="Body" id="p61p2" i="16">Judging from the outside, Jacob was a success. He had a large family,
          livestock, and wealth. But on the inside, he was an absolute mess! In fact, most of his
          story was a tragedy of his own making. He spent his life grabbing at what was not his,
          poisoning the relationships that should have sustained him. Instead of being able to enjoy
          what he worked so immorally to gain, he ran from his mistakes, wrestling with an identity
          and a past that were toxic to him and to those he loved.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p61p3" i="17">Despite his material success, Jacob was dissatisfied. Whether it was
          maturity, nostalgia, or regret, he began to miss what he had left behind enough to face
          the consequences of his actions and return to the scene of his crimes. He finally mustered
          the courage to gather up his entourage (which looked more like a traveling circus than a
          family road trip) and make the long trek back to his homeland.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p61p4" i="18">
          <span i="19">On the very last leg of his journey, Jacob learned that he was about to encounter
            the one person he needed to make amends with, his brother, Esau. The night before the
            confrontation, Jacob took everything he had accumulated—everything and everyone he had
            grabbed, deceived, or swindled to get—and sent them across a river called Jabbok, which
            means “Emptying.” Then he sat down alone.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p61p5" i="20">Finally, Jacob was by himself in the quiet to
          consider all that he had done with his life. It probably was the first time Jacob had been
          alone with his thoughts in a long time—only he wasn’t alone for long.</p>
