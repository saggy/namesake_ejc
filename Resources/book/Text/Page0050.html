        <p class="Body" id="p50p2" i="18">Why settle for one bowl of food when someday you will own all the bowls in
          the house, not to mention the house itself? I’d like to look down my nose at Esau for his
          shortsightedness, but the truth is that instant gratification sometimes gets the best of
          all of us. At one time or another, we’ve all looked at something right in front of us
          that, if chosen, would mean serious long-term consequences, and cried out, “Go for it!”
          Short-term pleasure is gratifying, but long-term regrets can be shattering. We know they
          were for Esau.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p50p3" i="19">Have some stew. Lose your birthright. By no means a
          fair deal.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p50p4" i="20">Jacob, too, experienced a gain and a loss in that moment. He gained exactly
          what he set out to grab in the first place. But what he lost was of great value as well.
          First, he lost a brother. They shared a womb, and parents, and a home, and now there was a
          rift there that would take an act of God to repair. He also lost any sense of goodness in
          himself as he surrendered to the dark side of his name. He spent the first half of his
          story struggling to take what was not rightfully his. We’ll see him complete the plan and
          then spend the second half of his life running away from the mistakes he made.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p50p5" i="21">Jacob’s epic struggle with the motivations within himself pulled him in two
          very different directions. His struggle raises an important question we must ask
          ourselves: <span class="char-style-override-17" i="22">Do I grab onto things for my own gain
            while leaving my relationships in the dust?</span> There’s a saying I love about the
          best rule to use when determining priorities: “People are more important than things.” It
          seems simple, but that lesson is hard to learn when you’re a small child whose brother or
          sister has a toy that you want. It’s just as hard to learn when you’re a grownup, hungry
          to fill some urge that will inevitably diminish a relationship that matters to you. What
          we fail to see when we grab what we want in the short-term is that the relationships we
          overlook are worth far more in the long-term.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p50p6" i="23">Learning to put relationships with others before personal gain is definitely
          not something that comes naturally. God urges us to break the easy pattern of putting
          ourselves first.</p>
