      <p class="Body">When Daniel worshipped, it took him beyond the borders of Babylon and back to the Temple in Jerusalem where he had worshipped as a boy. As he worshipped and prayed to God, Daniel was no longer a prisoner in a foreign land; he was a citizen of the kingdom of God.</p>

      <p class="Body">So, when a decree from the king said that no one could worship or pray to anyone but the king for a full month, Daniel was put in a tough situation. His three friends had faced a law that attempted to force them to worship something false. Now he was faced with a law that tried to force him <span class="char-style-override-17">not</span> to worship something true. This law was orchestrated by his enemies, who were deliberately trying to trap him.</p>

      <p class="Body">The fact that Daniel prayed three times every day in the same place, facing the direction of Jerusalem, was well known; and it tells us a lot about him. We know that he was faithful to worship God even in this foreign land where he was surrounded by a false religion. How easy it would have been to believe God was far away, unfeeling, or uncaring. Yet Daniel turned to God in prayer faithfully.</p>
