        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp" i="13">Mishael’s names can be seen in many of the
          names of God in Scripture, such as El Shaddai (God Almighty) and El Elyon (Most High God).
          Other names that include that suffix are Gabriel (Strength of God) and Michael (He Who Is
          Like God).</p>

        <p class="Body" i="14">In Week 2, Day 5 we learned about the unspoken name of God given to Moses as
          “I <span class="char-style-override-14" i="15">am</span>” at the burning bush. Although “I <span class="char-style-override-14" i="16">am</span>” in Hebrew is not pronounceable (YHWH has no
          vowels), it is sometimes pronounced Jehovah or Yahweh when vowels are added. The name
          Yahweh forms the suffix -<span class="char-style-override-17" i="17">aniah</span> or -<span class="char-style-override-17" i="18">iah</span> at the end of Hananiah and Azariah’s
          names.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="19">We don’t know anything else about Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah’s
          families, but we do know that they made a conscious effort from the first day of their
          lives to teach them about God and let them know that worshipping the one true God was part
          of the culture they were born into.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="20">I wonder if those families had a sense of the impending destruction of their
          surrounding culture and way of life. The Babylonians, under the leadership of King
          Nebuchadnezzar, invaded and destroyed Jerusalem in 605 <span class="char-style-override-14" i="21">b.c.</span>, destroying the city and the Temple. The four
          boys with God-centered names were probably in their early teen years when they became
          prisoners of war, taken back to the empire of Babylon when their beloved Jerusalem was
          destroyed.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="33">Nebuchadnezzar wanted to destroy the culture and convert the people. He
          wanted to make them Babylonian in culture, education, attitude, and religion. He knew that
          in order to do that he would need to conquer the hearts and minds of the leaders of the
          next generation, instilling in them a Babylonian way of life. He did this by taking an
          entire generation of leaders back to Babylon, where they would be treated not as prisoners
          of war or as slaves but as trainees for positions of leadership, influence, and power. He
          knew that if he could convert one generation away from their own religion and way of life,
          he would reach his goal.</p>
