          small. As we continue to follow his story throughout the week, I hope it also will teach
          us that no name is permanent if God wants to change it. It doesn’t matter how it is given
          or who gives it or how much it seems to mark us for life; God always has the power to
          start us over on a better-named path, showering us with His grace.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p47p3" i="19">Ask God to continue making you aware of the names that need
          to be removed from your internal nametag. As you go about your day, be aware of the words
          you speak in your internal monologue. When you are using words or names for yourself that
          are not positive, stop and ask God to help you replace those with His vision and names for
          you.</p>
