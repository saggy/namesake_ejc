       		<p style="text-align: justify;">Jacob’s story teaches us that words matter, no matter how small. 
        	As we continue to follow his story throughout the week, I hope it also will teach us that no 
name is permanent if God wants to change it. It doesn’t matter how it is given or 
who gives it or how much it seems to mark us for life; God always has the power 
to start us over on a better-named path, showering us with His grace.</p>

 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Pray About It</h3>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">Ask God to continue making you aware of the names that need to be removed 
from your internal nametag. As you go about your day, be aware of the words 
you speak in your internal monologue. When you are using words or names for 
yourself that are not positive, stop and ask God to help you replace those with 
His vision and names for you.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Act on It</h3>

      <ul class="command">
        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Think about the people in your life you’ve been given influence over. These 
can be family members, coworkers, or friends. How can God use you to 
“name” them this week?</li>
      </ul>

          <li class="PoetryText1"><sup>27</sup> The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, 
while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents. <sup>28</sup> Isaac, who had a taste for wild 
game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.</li>
          <li class="PoetryText1"><sup>29</sup> Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, 
famished. <sup>30</sup> He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” 
(That is why he was also called Edom.)</li>
          <li class="PoetryText1"><sup>31</sup> Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”</li>
          <li class="PoetryText1"><sup>32</sup> “Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?”</li>
          <li class="PoetryText1"><sup>33</sup> But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.</li>
