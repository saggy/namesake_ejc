    <p class="SUB1">Read God’s Word</p>
    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-18">1</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">The L</span><span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">2</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-18">3</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">4</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">5</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-17">“Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-18">6</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs of fine flour and knead it and bake some bread.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-18">7</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">8</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-18">9</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-17">“There, in the tent, ” he said.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-18">10</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Then the L</span><span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-17">Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.<br /></span> <span class="char-style-override-18">11</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">12</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-18">13</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Then the L</span><span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">14</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Is anything too hard for the L</span><span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span><span class="char-style-override-17">? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-18">15</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-17">But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.”</span></p>
