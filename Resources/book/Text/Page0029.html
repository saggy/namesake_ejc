    <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p29p13" i="51"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="52">Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.<br i="53"></span> <span class="char-style-override-18" i="54">11</span> <span class="char-style-override-17" i="55">Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18" i="56">12</span> <span class="char-style-override-17" i="57">So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?”</span></p>
