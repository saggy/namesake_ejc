        <p class="Body" id="p62p2" i="18">This all-night wrestling match was clearly a Divine encounter. Not only does
          the reference in Hosea 12 let us know that God was present here; the authority we see the
          mysterious wrestling partner display in renaming Jacob is the same authority displayed by
          God in renaming Jacob’s grandparents. Those clues help us see that God showed up in person
          in Jacob’s hour of need. That night forced Jacob to stop grasping at things and ambitions
          and grab hold of God Himself. Still, Jacob was bold enough to ask his wrestling partner
          for a blessing.</p>

              32:27</span>.</span>
          <span class="char-style-override-21" i="23">When Jacob asked for a blessing, what did his
            wrestling partner ask him, and what was Jacob’s answer?</span>
        </p>

        <div class="answer" id="a24" onclick="answer(this)" question="Reread Genesis 32:27. When Jacob asked for a blessing, what did his wrestling partner ask him, and what was Jacob's answer?" i="24"></div>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p62p5" i="25">The last time Jacob had asked for a blessing (from
          his father), he had lied, misrepresented himself, and taken on the identity of his
          brother. This time when Jacob asked for a blessing (from his heavenly Father), he was
          again asked in return, “What is your name?” His answer was both an introduction and a
          confession: “I am Jacob,” he said truthfully. Deceiver. Swindler. Taker of what is not
          mine.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p62p6" i="26">
          <span i="27">God must have been satisfied with that answer, because He knew it took a lot for
            Jacob to speak the truth at last. Even so, He wasn’t satisfied with the man standing
            before Him. God wants to hear our honest confession and assessment of who we are and
            where we find ourselves, but that doesn’t mean He’ll leave us that way. Only when we are
            honest about our desperate state and our desperate need for Him can He set about
            changing us to become the ones He wants us to be.</span>

        <div class="answer" id="a32" onclick="answer(this)" question="Reread Genesis 32:28. What new name did God give to Jacob, and why?" i="32"></div>

        <p class="Body" id="p62p9" i="33">At that moment, Jacob the Deceiver no longer existed. The man left limping
          at daybreak was now Israel—which means “He Who Wrestles with God.” The nation that once
          was promised to Abraham and Sarah now had a name. They were the children of Israel—the
          ones who wrestle with God.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p62p10" i="34">But that isn’t the end of the story. Jacob went on to
          ask the name of his wrestling partner. We will explore this in greater depth tomorrow. For
          now, take note of the answer Jacob’s wrestling partner gave and how Jacob responded.</p>
