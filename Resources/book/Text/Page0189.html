      <p class="Body" i="24">In the telling of this story of the unnamed woman, the gospel writer never questions that she was guilty of the sin of which she was accused. But just as guilty as the one who was breaking the law were the ones who were using the law to break her. As Jesus stooped and wrote on the ground that day, His message—whatever He might have written—somehow sunk deeper than just the dirt in which He wrote. It cut straight to the hearts of those who were watching and listening.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="25"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="26"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="27">Take one more look at <span onclick="biblepop('John.8.7')" i="28">John 8:7</span>. After Jesus wrote in the dirt the first time, what did He say to the woman’s accusers?</span></p>

      <p class="Body" i="30">Finally, the men who had wielded the law like a weapon, both against the woman and against Jesus, were redirected to look within their own hearts. They stopped looking at her, or at Jesus, and started looking at themselves. And they gave up their quest and began, one by one, to walk away.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="31">God wants our obedience, but even more than that, He wants our hearts. He doesn’t want us to treat our relationship with Him like a marriage in which the partners keep their vows out of obligation. He wants us to be deeply and passionately in love with Him, longing to spend time with Him and to share the joy of our love with others.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="32">If you sometimes feel like you’ve been following God out of obligation or duty, or that the joy of knowing Him has dimmed, you’re not alone. All of us have ups and downs in our relationship with God. But you can know today without a doubt that He loves you deeply and personally, that you matter to Him. The God who created you and knows you through and through longs to write His love for you on your heart.</p>
