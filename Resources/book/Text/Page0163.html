      <p class="SUB1">Reflect and Respond</p>

      <p class="Paragraph-Style-1"></p>

      <p class="Body">I hesitate to tell strangers what I do for a living. People traditionally clam up when I tell them I’m a pastor. Something about standing next to a representative of God makes them think of all the things they’ve done wrong or all the Sundays they’ve slept in instead of going to church.</p>

      <p class="Body">I thought I was the only one who was hesitant to tell people what I did for a living. Then I met my husband, Jim. When we first started dating, he had been a math professor for several years. When Jim would tell people that he taught math, their response was almost inevitably negative: “I hated math in school!” It wasn’t exactly a great conversation starter. We were quite the life of the party— the preacher and the math professor!</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">The mere mention of Jim’s profession caused most people to reflect on how inadequate they felt the last time they sat in math class struggling over an algebra problem or stood at the chalkboard fearing the ridicule of their classmates as they tried to solve a differential equation. Math brought back bad memories for people.</p>

      <p class="Body">Honestly, we both learned not to take it personally when people scowled within minutes of meeting us. In a way, the reasons behind the reactions people had to our professions weren’t that different. The negative experiences of the past still left a bad impression in their minds that caused a shudder at just the mention of God or church or arithmetic.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">You know, God and arithmetic actually can be a winning combination, because God’s arithmetic is a freeing thing.</p>

      <p class="Body">When Jesus took away Simon’s old name and gave him a new one, it wasn’t so much an act of subtraction. Jesus’ renaming of Simon was more an exercise in addition. While some other individuals whose names changed lost their old names for good (Abraham, for example, was never called Abram again once God gave him a new name), you may have noticed that Simon Peter kept his old name throughout much of his story.</p>

      <p class="Body">We’ve already noticed that, though he is referred to as Peter often in Scripture, there were times Jesus called him out on his pre-conversion behavior by calling him by his old name. There were even more times, though, when he was referred</p>
