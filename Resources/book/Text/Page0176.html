        <p style="text-align: justify;">Linda and John wanted a full house of children to love. Their daughter, Alice, 
was the delight of their hearts, but they were even more thrilled when they found 
out she was going to become a big sister. When their second little girl was born,

was on the way.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Linda and John thought long and hard about what would be an appropriate 
name for this fifth and final girl. What name would reflect the humor they saw in
