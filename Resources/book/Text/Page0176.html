        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="25">Linda and John wanted a full house of children to love. Their daughter, Alice, 
was the delight of their hearts, but they were even more thrilled when they found 
out she was going to become a big sister. When their second little girl was born, 
they decided that John would name her, and he chose the name Bryce. The two 
little blond-haired, blue-eyed girls grew together surrounded by love. Soon 
Linda discovered she was expecting again, and she began to think about names. 
She realized something that hadn’t occurred to her before: her first two children 
were named with the first two letters of the alphabet. Even though they hadn’t 
begun the trend on purpose, they decided not to break it; and when their third 
daughter arrived, they named her Crystyl, so that the three sisters could be A, B, 
and C. The big family they had hoped for was growing quickly.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="26">Despite her love for her giggling group of little girls, Linda still dreamed of 
having a son. It seemed she might get her chance when she found out she was 
pregnant again. The big day arrived and they were blessed with a bouncing baby 
. . . girl. D’Andra it was. Four girls seemed quite enough, so Linda and John 
considered their family complete.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="27">Thinking she was done having children, Linda settled into being the mom of 
four wonderful daughters—until a few years later she discovered they weren’t 
done after all! She thought that maybe this was God’s way of fulfilling her dream 
of a little boy. It turned out that God had a sense of humor. Their fifth daughter 
was on the way.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="28">Linda and John thought long and hard about what would be an appropriate 
name for this fifth and final girl. What name would&nbsp;reflect the humor they saw in 
God’s gift of so many girls? What name would help the youngest of five sisters 
not to take herself too seriously? They thought carefully of names that would 
capture her place as the caboose in the alphabetical family line and reflect the<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="29"></p>
