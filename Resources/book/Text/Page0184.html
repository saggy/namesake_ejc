      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Tony and Karen had a storybook beginning. They met singing together in the choir at church where Tony, a baritone, kept turning around to sneak peeks at Karen in the alto section. Long talks in the church parking lot after rehearsal turned into a whirlwind courtship and engagement. The choir sang at their wedding. Everyone said they were the perfect couple. Tony was nearly twenty years her senior, but Karen felt he was the man she had been looking for all her life. They had two little boys and settled down into a life that seemed perfect to everyone on the outside looking in.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">On the inside, however, things were falling apart. Tony was demanding and controlling, insisting that Karen report her whereabouts at all times and badgering her until she ended most of her friendships and activities outside the home. She felt trapped and isolated. When a man she worked with asked her one day why she looked so sad, she broke down and confided in him about her misery at home. He was warm and understanding, and she began secretly looking forward to bumping into him in the break room. When he asked if she was going to a company event out of town in a few weeks and if they could drive there together, she blushed and was flattered. A nagging thought in the back of her mind warned her to stop, but she was trying hard to ignore it.</p>

      <p class="Body">When a couple gets married, they have to apply for a license, sign their names in agreement, and take vows—a verbal contract—before witnesses. But no one wants his or her spouse’s actions in marriage to be motivated by contractual agreement. We do want our spouses to keep their marriage vows, certainly, but out of much more than obligation. We want their actions toward us to be motivated not only by duty but also by love. We want their hearts.</p>

      <p class="Body">Even though both Tony and Karen might have been keeping the letter of the law of their marriage contract, the relationship sealed by their vows was certainly suffering. Marriage is an agreement written on more than a marriage license; it is written on the hearts of the two people who enter into it together.</p>

      <p class="Body">As we read in Day 1, Jesus was confronted in the Temple and asked to play judge in a very sensitive case. He had been put on the spot many times in his ministry, but this one was crucial. The decision Jesus was being forced to make</p>
