    <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="28">I know when I read the Bible I’m supposed to feel holier, wiser, closer to God. But I have to admit that sometimes, while I’m reading some of the greatest stories in Scripture, I actually feel a little jealous. I’m sure that’s not a very saintly response, but I can’t help it. I confess I have miracle envy. And I like to eat cookie dough ice cream right out of the carton. Bless me, for I have sinned.</p>

    <p class="Body" i="29">When I read the awesome stories of how God worked in people’s lives in powerful and visible ways, I find myself wishing that God would show up and work in the same way in my life. Sometimes I think my faith would be stronger and my doubts weaker if I could just witness the kinds of events that people in the Bible were able to witness up close and personal.</p>

    <p class="Body" i="30">But then I remember that even those who saw miracles with their own eyes didn’t always believe. Moses still doubted his ability to lead even after God spelled it out through the burning bush. The disciples had trouble understanding Jesus’ messages and believing in His power even after learning from Him and seeing Him perform miracles with their own eyes. They heard Jesus explain that He would die and rise from the dead, and yet they still didn’t understand what was going on when it happened. If the people who had front row seats to God’s visible miracles didn’t get it, what makes me think I would be different?</p>
