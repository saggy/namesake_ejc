        <p class="Body">When Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah made the right decision to stand up to a
          law that ordered them to worship idols, they weren’t rewarded; they were punished. The
          king’s anger burned so greatly that he ordered them to be tied and thrown into a blazing
          furnace heated seven times hotter than usual, mirroring the combustion of his rage. It’s
          important for us to remember that just because we follow God’s will does not mean we’re
          immune to the earthly consequences of our actions, however unfair they may be.</p>

        <p class="Body">Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah weren’t excused from the fiery furnace just
          because they did the right thing in God’s eyes. The miracle comes, though, when those
          watching see not three people in the fire, but four.</p>

        <p class="Body">We can’t always be sure of our earthly safety because we are God’s
          followers, but we can be sure that God goes with us into the most fiery of situations.
          When we stand for God, we don’t stand alone; He always stands with us.</p>
