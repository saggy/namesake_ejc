    	 <p class="Body">Jesus knew that in order to feel better about ourselves, we would be tempted to ignore our own shortcomings and point our fingers at other people. Their sins seem so much bigger, but in reality they’re just more visible while ours stay hidden away in our hearts.</p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read <span onclick="biblepop('Luke.18.9')">Luke 18:9</span>-14 and answer the following questions:</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">What did the Pharisee thank God for? Where was he pointing his finger to point out sin?</span></p>

       	  <div class="answer" id="p193la1" onclick="answer(this)"question="What did the Pharisee thank God for? Where was he pointing his finger to point out sin?"></div>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">What did the tax collector focus on? Where was he pointing his finger to point out sin?</span></p>

       	  <div class="answer" id="p193la2" onclick="answer(this)"question="What did the tax collector focus on? Where was he pointing his finger to point out sin?"></div>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Which man was more likely to encounter God’s grace? Why?</span></p>

       	  <div class="answer" id="p193la3" onclick="answer(this)"question="Which man was more likely to encounter God’s grace? Why?"></div>

      <p class="Body">When we talk about sin but don’t want to sound judgmental, we often use the phrase “Love the sinner, hate the sin.” That phrase is filled with good intentions, but it’s still a symptom of our outward focus when it comes to sin. How often have you heard anyone say, “God hates sin. And God hates <span class="char-style-override-17">my</span> sin! He hates my greed, my selfishness, my lust, my&nbsp;unforgiveness, my jealousy, my critical nature”?</p>

      <p class="Body">The story of the unnamed woman shows us that God does want us to be on the lookout for sin, but the place He wants us to look is within ourselves. When we do, we will always find room for improvement. It also shows us how to look within the heart of God and find compassion and grace. This helps us to keep from beating ourselves up about our past mistakes.</p>

      <p class="Body">The intersection of those two hearts laid bare—our own heart marred by sin and the heart of Jesus, sinless and ready to forgive—is a beautiful place. Honesty about our own need for God’s powerful and undeserved grace is the only thing that will bring us to confession, which pushes out sin and brings about a vacuum to be filled with forgiveness.</p>
