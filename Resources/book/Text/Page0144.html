        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Reflect and Respond</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">When I answered the call to follow Jesus, I was a mess—selfish and immature. 
As it became clear to me that God loved me and wanted a better life for me, I 
often had doubts that I was worthy of God’s love. I wasn’t sure why He would 
choose me to be His follower, much less a leader.</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">I remember thinking that the people in the Bible were perfect, holy examples 
for us to follow—examples I knew I’d never live up to. After all, why did we 
call them “Saint Matthew” or “Saint John” on our church signs? When I got to 
the story of Simon, however, there was no denying that this guy was no saint! 
I remember reading about Simon Peter’s antics, trying hard to figure out why 
this perfectly flawed person had been given such a central place in Jesus’ perfect 
story. It helped me to figure out that while he wasn’t a saint, he was an ordinary 
man that I could identify with. If God loved Simon Peter and thought He could 
use him for good, there might just be hope for me as well!</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">When Simon answered the call to follow Jesus, he was a mess. He was impulsive, brash, immature, and reckless. His temper flared and he usually spoke up 
before his brain could intervene. Jesus knew He had His work cut out for Him 
where Simon was concerned. But for some reason, Jesus chose Simon. Not only 
was he chosen to be a follower; he was chosen as a leader for the disciples and the 
ragtag collection of imperfect people who would come to be called the church.</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">How do we know that Jesus singled out Simon Peter as a leader? </p>
