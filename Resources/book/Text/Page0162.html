      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">1</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way:</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">2</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">3</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;“I’m going out to fish,” Simon Peter told them, and they said, “We’ll go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">4</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">5</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;He called out to them, “Friends, haven’t you any fish?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-17">“No,” they answered.</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">6</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;He said, “Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.” When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">7</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, “It is the Lord,” he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">8</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">9</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">10</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">11</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">12</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">13&nbsp;</span><span class="char-style-override-17">Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">14&nbsp;</span><span class="char-style-override-17">This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">15</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-17">“Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I love you.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-17">Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">16&nbsp;</span><span class="char-style-override-17">Again Jesus said, “Simon son of John, do you truly love me?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-17">He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-17">Jesus said, “Take care of my sheep.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">17</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;The third time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-17">Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-17">Jesus said, “Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">18</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed</p>
