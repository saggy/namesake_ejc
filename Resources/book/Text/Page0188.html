      <p class="Body" i="21"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="22">Why do you think God uses the imagery of Jesus as Groom and the church as bride? What might He be trying to tell us about the kind of love He has for us and the kind of relationship He wants with us?</span></p>

    	  <div class="answer" id="a23" onclick="answer(this)" question="Why do you think God uses the imagery of Jesus as Groom and the church as bride? What might He be trying to tell us about the kind of love He has for us and the kind of relationship He wants with us?" i="23"></div>

      <p class="Body" i="24">One of my favorite privileges as a pastor is to perform weddings. I love standing next to the groom as the back doors of the church open and the bride is revealed. I love to see his face when he first sees his bride. It is a look of pure delight. The Bible says that is the way God looks at <span class="char-style-override-17" i="25">you</span>!</p>

      <p class="Body" i="26">A groom doesn’t take his marriage vows with misery through gritted teeth. A bride doesn’t walk down the aisle with dread of the days ahead of her. They both have joyful expectation. This kind of relationship exists not because of an obligation or a signed piece of paper. It exists out of mutual love. In this kind of relationship, the other person is not a burden, a “ball and chain”; he or she is the light and love of the other’s life.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="27">God’s law has sometimes been described as a love letter from God because it can help guide and protect our relationship with Him, allowing us to behave on the outside in ways that mirror the love we have for Him on the inside. When we understand our relationship with God in this way, it’s not too much of a leap to recognize why, in Scripture, idolatry is often associated with adultery. Turning away from God and seeking other things to worship is equated with cheating on a relationship. It tells us that the core of the Gospel is more than a list of rules; it’s the very personal heart of God.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="29"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="30">Read <span onclick="biblepop('Ezek.6.9')" i="31">Ezekiel 6:9</span>. Why do you think idolatry is compared to spiritual adultery?</span></p>

    	  <div class="answer" id="a32" onclick="answer(this)" question="Read Ezekiel 6:9. Why do you think idolatry is compared to spiritual adultery?" i="32"></div>

      <p class="Body" i="33">In the story of the woman dragged before Jesus for judgment, the men who hauled her there against her will were guilty of a different kind of sin. They were worshipping an idol: the law itself. They cared far more about the law than they did about a relationship with the God behind it. They wanted to use the law to prove they were more holy than those around them. They were more concerned with the law God wrote than the people God loved.</p>
