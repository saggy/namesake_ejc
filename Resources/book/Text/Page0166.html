 <p class="Body" i="13"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="14">What does <span onclick="biblepop('1Cor.13.5')" i="15">1 Corinthians 13:5</span> say about keeping count of the times someone has wronged us?</span></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="17">Of all the times Simon Peter should have been grateful for a math lesson, it was that one, because it turned out he was going to need it. “How many times should we forgive someone, Lord? Five, six, seven? Should I keep count on my fingers?” After denying Jesus, Peter was definitely in need of a seventy-times-seven kind of forgiveness. And the days surrounding Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection were a perfect time to see Jesus put that promise into action.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="18">When Jesus and Peter finally met up again, things were different. Jesus, for one, had paid the price for the sins of all of humanity, risen from the dead, and conquered the grave. He had been a little busy. Peter, on the other hand, had decided to go fishing.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="19">It’s a beautiful thing, the symmetry of this story in Acts: the way that Jesus met Peter in the exact place where they had begun; the way that He gave a fishing lesson to the most seasoned fishermen and the nets were so full they almost broke. Speaking of math—this storyteller cares so much about detail that he even lets us know exactly how many fish were caught that day (<span onclick="biblepop('John.21.11')" i="20">John 21:11</span>).</p>

      <p class="Body" i="21"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="22"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="23">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('John.21.15')" i="24">John 21:15</span>-17. What question did Jesus ask Peter three times in these verses?</span></p>

    	  <div class="answer" id="a25" onclick="answer(this)" question="Reread John 21:15-17. What question did Jesus ask Peter three times in these verses?" i="25"></div>

      <p class="Body" i="26"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="27">What did Jesus say to Peter in verse 19?</span></p>

    	  <div class="answer" id="a28" onclick="answer(this)" question="What did Jesus say to Peter in verse 19?" i="28"></div>

      <p class="Body" i="29">When Jesus called out to Peter, “Follow me,” it must have felt like déjà vu. Those were the words of his original calling. Now they were the words that called him back, letting him know that Jesus wanted him to follow in the same way as he did that first day, just as much now that Jesus had seen him at his worst as in the very beginning.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="30">“Simon, do you love me?” Jesus asked. After giving three knife-in-the-heart denials the night before Jesus died, Peter received three chances to answer this all-important question. With each question, Jesus used his old name, his original name, Simon. Using this name said: “I know who you are, and I love you anyway. I know your struggle and pain, and I know that you are your own worst enemy; and I’m still here to offer you help.”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="31">Three times he fell asleep in the garden. “Simon . . . couldn’t you stay awake?” (<span onclick="biblepop('Mark.14.37')" i="32">Mark 14:37</span> NCV).</p>

      <p class="Body" i="33">Three times he denied Jesus as predicted. “Simon, Satan has asked to sift . . . you like wheat” (<span onclick="biblepop('Luke.22.31')" i="34">Luke 22:31</span> NLT).</p>
