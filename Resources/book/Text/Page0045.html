          to accomplish seems beyond my abilities or comfort zone. In those moments the adjectives
          that popped into my head were names of sorts, things I had been called by peers or
          unwitting family members who never knew their words would stick and come to the surface
          later in life.</p>

          those that we have been given by people who shower us with encouragement and admiration,
          and those that have been given in careless moments of criticism. The reminder that we are
          also accountable for naming the people we love with our words is a sobering and sacred
          responsibility.</p>
