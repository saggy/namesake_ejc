    <p class="Body">Perhaps God’s reluctance to articulate His name to scoundrels like Jacob and leaders like Moses had little to do with their ability to control Him by speaking it aloud. Maybe it had more to do with the fact that the nature of God is best discovered not through some word on the tip of our tongues but through following Him, observing His actions, and discovering His nature through His fingerprints in the world.</p>
