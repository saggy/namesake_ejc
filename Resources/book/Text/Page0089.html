        <p class="Body" id="p89p6" i="28">When they arrived in Bethlehem, Ruth found herself in a desperate situation.
          In that particular time and culture, the male members of the household would work to
          supply food and shelter for their family. Ruth and Naomi had no one to provide for them, a
          situation that made their grief and loss seem even more hopeless. If no one took action on
          their behalf, it was possible that they could starve or be forced to beg on the
          streets.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p89p7" i="29">Instead of wallowing or waiting for someone else to take responsibility,
          Ruth channeled her grief, worry, and anxiety into action. With Naomi’s blessing, she went
          to the fields each day to glean—to gather the leftovers the harvesters had dropped. She
          worked tirelessly until sundown, and we’re told she worked the entire season until the
          harvest had finished. Ruth’s initiative and determination saved her life and Naomi’s, and
          it set into motion a course of events that would change their lives forever.</p>
