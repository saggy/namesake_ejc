She had just left her homeland, including her family and friends and everything familiar and comforting to her, just as Naomi had done after the famine. Ruth must have experienced the same pain and tears that Naomi did. She may have even gone through similar stages of anger and depression. But in chapter 2, Ruth’s grief begins to take on a different shape.</p>

    <p class="Body">When they arrived in Bethlehem, Ruth found herself in a desperate situation. In that particular time and culture, the male members of the household would work to supply food and shelter for their family. Ruth and Naomi had no one to provide for them, a situation that made their grief and loss seem even more hopeless. If no one took action on their behalf, it was possible that they could starve or be forced to beg on the streets.</p>

    <p class="Body">Instead of wallowing or waiting for someone else to take responsibility, Ruth channeled her grief, worry, and anxiety into action. With Naomi’s blessing, she went to the fields each day to glean—to gather the leftovers the harvesters had dropped. She worked tirelessly until sundown, and we’re told she worked the entire season until the harvest had finished. Ruth’s initiative and determination saved her life and Naomi’s, and it set into motion a course of events that would change their lives forever.</p>
