        <p class="Body">The psalms give us a picture of familiarity and freedom where our
          relationship with God is concerned. When you feel like pouring out your heart to God—even
          if your emotions are negative, you can take heart that God has heard all of it before. You
          can tell Him anything. If you’re experiencing anger or bitterness toward God like Naomi
          did, you can talk to Him about it. God can take it. We never have to gloss things over in
          prayer, to be afraid of God’s reaction, or to try to hide our negative feelings from
          Him.</p>
