        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp" id="p60p1" i="13">young adulthood with all the baggage from
          growing up with a dad who put his addiction before his family. Now she was struggling in
          her own fight with a devastating drug habit, which had come close to destroying the life
          of her young daughter.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p60p2" i="14">Tim and his wife were taking steps to turn their family around. They had
          begun attending church, sought counseling, and obtained guardianship of their young
          granddaughter. Watching this little girl that he loved so much grow up before his eyes
          made Tim long for true change. He was desperate to do things differently this time around,
          to have a positive impact on this generation after he had messed up so badly with the one
          before.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p60p3" i="15">As his family tried to plug into our community for support, he told me that
          he was trying to reach out and form friendships but that he often felt like a misfit.
          Everyone around him seemed to have it together. He wasn’t sure how to be real about his
          own problems in a church and neighborhood where every time he asked how they were, people
          smiled and said they were “fine.” Tim didn’t feel fine. How could he find a way to belong
          here?</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p60p4" i="16">Tim’s counselor encouraged him to get involved in a community of others who
          were struggling to overcome addiction. When he walked into his first meeting, he was
          shocked to see so many of his perfect-looking neighbors. It was a room full of people who
          looked like they had it all together but were falling apart on the inside.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p60p5" i="17">Tim told me about one woman who never would have struck him as someone with
          any problems at all. She was perfectly put together, wearing an immaculate and expensive
          outfit. She told the group that as she gained control over her addiction to alcohol, she
          had replaced that addiction with a compulsive spending habit. Her spiral into debt was so
          out of control that it looked like her family might lose their home.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p60p6" i="18">“Our mortgage hasn’t been paid in full in months,” she said as she
          straightened out her designer outfit. “But you’d better believe our country club dues are
          up to date. We wouldn’t want to look bad to our neighbors!”</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p60p7" i="19">That’s when Tim had an “aha!” moment. He said, “I realized I had been
          comparing my insides to everyone else’s outsides.” He knew all too well the mess of what
          he was wrestling with, but he never spent much time thinking about the fact that everyone
          he met was struggling in some way.</p>
