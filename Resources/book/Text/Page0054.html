    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Complete the following sentence:</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">I’ll be happy when. . . . Jacob seems to have lived by that motto. He grew up staring across the table at his brother, who was to receive the birthright and blessing, and dreaming of a day he could have them for himself. Riddled with envy and discontent,&nbsp;Jacob spent his childhood and early adulthood longing for what was not his and scheming how to get it. His attitude toward his brother and his parents was shadowed in a cloud of discontent and dishonesty.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Is there a person or group of people that you’ve had an attitude of envy toward? If so, how has it affected your relationship with them?</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">Jacob made the mistake of determining his happiness based on what his brother had. Our worth isn’t determined by how we measure up against other people; it is determined by how God loves us.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">What does each of these Scriptures help you understand about God’s love for us and the relationship between that love and our love for others?</span></p>

    <p class="Body">Truthfully, Jacob had help developing this attitude. As with most family problems, the issues between Jacob and his brother, Esau, didn’t just spring up out of nowhere. They had been brewing in the genes and behavior of this unusual family for generations. As we learned yesterday, the ways that Isaac and Rebekah treated their boys contributed to the conflict between the brothers.</p>
