        <p class="Body" id="p54p7" i="28">I’ll be happy when. . . . Jacob seems to have lived by that motto. He grew
          up staring across the table at his brother, who was to receive the birthright and
          blessing, and dreaming of a day he could have them for himself. Riddled with envy and
          discontent,&nbsp;Jacob spent his childhood and early adulthood longing for what was not
          his and scheming how to get it. His attitude toward his brother and his parents was
          shadowed in a cloud of discontent and dishonesty.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p54p18" i="56">Truthfully, Jacob had help developing this attitude. As with most family
          problems, the issues between Jacob and his brother, Esau, didn’t just spring up out of
          nowhere. They had been brewing in the genes and behavior of this unusual family for
          generations. As we learned yesterday, the ways that Isaac and Rebekah treated their boys
          contributed to the conflict between the brothers.</p>
