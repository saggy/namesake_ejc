      <p class="Body" i="22"><span class="char-style-override-18" i="23">20</span><span class="char-style-override-17" i="24">&nbsp;But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18" i="25">21</span><span class="char-style-override-17" i="26">&nbsp;She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="43">Names are at the center of the sacred ceremonies we hold as Christians. Baptisms, weddings, funerals—all of them are a mix of the sacred and the intimate. Because they’re so personal in nature, at the heart of each of them is a person’s first name.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="44">“What name is given this child?” “Do you . . . take . . . to be your lawfully wedded husband?” “We are gathered today to remember and give thanks for the life of...”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="45">When I preside over one of these sacred ceremonies, I always make sure I have the first name(s) written in big and bold letters across the top of my notes. Every pastor knows there would be nothing worse than saying the wrong name at a wedding. If you do, the confusion in the eyes of the bride and groom is instant. The glares from the mothers would quickly follow. Even worse would be to say the wrong name at a funeral. You really don’t want to make a mistake at the most personal of moments when someone’s name is involved.</p>
