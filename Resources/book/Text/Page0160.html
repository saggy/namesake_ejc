    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">that failure is like a sieve that can strengthen us—and that those who bounce back are substance, not chaff. Jesus has ordered the world so that the strengthened become the strengtheners—so that we not only learn from our moments of disappointing God but also enable others to learn from them as well.</p>

      <p class="Body">Why did the gospel writers include this unfortunate story of the leader of the disciples denying his Messiah and closest friend? Because it can strengthen our faith, too. Our failures, our moments of disappointing God, aren’t meant to be kept in the dark as secret moments of shame. We can bring them out in the light as testimonies for others to see God’s gracious and forgiving nature in the face of disappointment.</p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read <span onclick="biblepop('1Jn.2.12')">1 <span onclick="biblepop('John.2.12')">John 2:12</span></span>. Why have we been forgiven?</span></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Some translations say that we have been forgiven “for His name’s sake.” Others say we have been forgiven “on account of his name”—in other words, to make a name for God, to advertise that God is gracious and merciful, even when our actions are crushing. Eden may have been a perfect world, but the one thing it didn’t have was forgiveness—the ability to meet disappointment not by recoiling or lashing out but by offering&nbsp;grace.</p>

      <p class="Body">I long for that perfect world sometimes. But if humanity had stayed there, we never would have known how God deals with disappointment. Just as we have a choice, God has a choice. He could choose to reject us or to offer us a cold shoulder. Instead, I believe God rolls up His sleeves with a sense of excitement: “Now I get to show them what I’m really made of.” We’ll find out in tomorrow’s reading just how God chose to pour out grace to Peter.</p>

      <p class="Body">When my friend hurt me, I had a choice. I have to admit that it was tempting to withdraw, to lick my wounds, to pretend that our friendship never mattered to me in the first place. Instead, I am choosing daily to respond to disappointment with the same enthusiasm as Jesus. If my friend had never hurt me, I never would have had a chance to show what I’m truly made of as a child of God: grace.</p>

      <p class="Body">When others disappoint you, you have a chance to respond by showing the nature of God in a completely new way. In a perfect world, that part of God’s nature in you would remain hidden. Instead, let grace give you away.</p>
