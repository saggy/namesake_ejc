        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp" id="p49p2">while Esau would receive a larger share
          called the birthright. Then, upon their father’s death, Esau would receive the blessing as
          well, a spiritual inheritance on top of the final confirmation of the material one. This
          meant the elder would succeed the father as patriarch of the family and the younger would
          be subservient to his sibling as the ruler and owner of the estate as well as the
          spiritual leader. Being first definitely had its perks!</p>


        <p class="Body" id="p49p3">This hierarchy certainly played a part in the conflict between the two
          brothers. There also were other factors that contributed to the discord.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p49p6">Jacob wasn’t going to settle for second. His name,
          innocently given as a reminder of his hand on his brother’s chubby heel, could also mean
          “Deceiver, Supplanter, Swindler”—one who grabs hold of what is not his own and takes it.
          And grab Jacob did.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p49p7">One day when he saw the moment to take advantage of his brother, he grabbed
          it. His older brother, Esau, was a hairy, ruddy, outdoorsy type. He came home famished
          from a long hunting trip to find that his irritating little brother, Jacob, had just
          dished himself up the last bowl of food in the house. Today we’d just grab some
          microwavable meal and the whole issue would be over in sixty seconds, but this was a day
          when the recipe for chicken nuggets started with the instructions “Go in the backyard and
          kill a chicken.” Preparing a meal could take all day, and Esau was hungry <span class="char-style-override-17">now</span>.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p49p8">Jacob milked the situation for all it was worth. He was younger, and younger
          children know that, generally, they can’t win in strength, so they have to win in
          strategy. You have to devise a plan that is going to get you either beaten up or a really
          good trade.</p>
