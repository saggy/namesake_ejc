    <p class="Body">When we named our daughter Katherine Juliet, friends commented that her name sounded like royalty, or at least like someone out of Shakespeare. The Kate most talked about in the news in the last couple of years is royalty, a real-life princess: the beautifully poised young woman who will probably be the next queen of England. I’ve kept some pictures of the wedding of Kate and Prince William, which took place while I was pregnant with our little Kate, so that she can see them someday. Watching that royal wedding took so many women back to the dreams of their childhood, like watching a real-life fairy tale.</p>

    <p class="Body">Now that I have a daughter, I do feel a certain excitement about a future that includes watching movies about princesses and playing dress up with gowns, pearls, and tiaras. As a girl I loved all the Disney princess movies, the ones that told basically the same story:&nbsp;a princess, beautiful but helpless, finds herself in a dangerous situation and needs someone to rescue her. A prince, of the charming variety, comes along and is enraptured by her loveliness. He fights the battle she needs fought. She is overwhelmed with gratitude, falls into his arms, and they live happily ever after.</p>

    <p class="Body">But along with nostalgia for the stories I loved as a little girl, I also have a growing wariness about these fairy tales. I’m starting to realize that although those stories captured my imagination and gave me some of my first dreams of romance, they also did me a great disservice. They planted a desire in me for someone to come along when I was in distress, rescue me from my reality, and carry me away to happily-ever-after.</p>
