their family, in the life of this scared teenager, and in the life of the baby girl she 
was carrying. By the next morning, they turned to each other willing to consider 
the possibility that this baby they had only heard about might be meant for them.</p><p id="p75p2" i="14">
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" id="p75p3" i="15">In just a matter of weeks, three days after L.J.’s due date, Grace Carolyn Allen 
was born. When Jack and Jessica arrived at the hospital and were ushered down 
the hall to the room where Grace was being born, they walked in to realize it was 
the exact room where L.J. had made his unexpected arrival just months earlier. 
The doctor placed the baby girl in Jack’s open arms with the words “meet your 
daughter.” The gift they received that day was a minor miracle, evidence that 
God was not done offering them goodness and mercy. Nothing could replace 
their son or minimize the impact of his life, but it was clear God was doing something amazing through their family’s story. There would be new tales to tell of 
the joy that entered their lives through a little girl named Grace. The story of 
Grace is proof to all who hear it that the grace of God is still at work, even when 
we feel all has been lost. </p><p id="p75p4" i="16">

was sure that life was over when she lost those she loved so dearly. Watch her 
story carefully, though, and you’ll see that her life didn’t end when grief entered. 
God’s plans to bring grace to Naomi’s life were far from over. A true friend, a 
fresh start, and God’s redeeming mercy were about to break into the darkness 
she felt. Grace was just around the corner.</p><p id="p75p6" i="18">
