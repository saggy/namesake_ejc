    <p class="Body"><span onclick="biblepop('Prov.18.10')">Proverbs 18:10</span> declares that “The name of the L<span class="char-style-override-14">ord</span> is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.” A life built for our own glory will only crumble into confusion. A life built for the glory of God’s name provides a strong tower, a safe place to reflect, to hope, to grow.</p>

    <p class="Body">When we recognize just how badly we need to change, it’s important that we know the God who never changes. His strength provides an unshakeable foundation, a place where we can trust our hearts to the work of a transforming God.</p>

    <p class="SUB1">Pray About It</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">Find a time and place you can pray out loud. Begin your time of prayer by speaking God’s name aloud several times. You might say Lord or Jesus or some other name you’ve heard used for God such as Shepherd, Warrior, Creator, or Comforter. Ask God to teach you more about Himself and how He wants to be part of your life. Let God know that you aren’t calling to ask Him to do things your way but, in agreement with who He is, you want to be part of His plan for the world and for your future.</p>

    <p class="SUB1">Act on It</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">• Pick a “trigger” this week that will call you to a brief prayer. This can be when you’re stopped at a stop sign or a traffic light, when you start preparing or eating a meal, or when you climb stairs. Choose something that happens multiple times each day. When you encounter that trigger, call on God’s name, praising Him.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">• What is one specific lesson you learned this week that you want to apply daily? Write a verse or word on a card and put it in an obvious place: your bathroom mirror, your car dashboard, and so on. When you see it, ask God to help you make what you’re learning in this study a daily reality.</p>
