        <p class="Body" id="p38p2"><span onclick="biblepop('Prov.18.10')">Proverbs 18:10</span> declares that
          “The name of the L<span class="char-style-override-14">ord</span> is a strong tower; the
          righteous run to it and are safe.” A life built for our own glory will only crumble into
          confusion. A life built for the glory of God’s name provides a strong tower, a safe place
          to reflect, to hope, to grow.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p38p3">When we recognize just how badly we need to change, it’s important that we
          know the God who never changes. His strength provides an unshakeable foundation, a place
          where we can trust our hearts to the work of a transforming God.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p38p8">Find a time and place you can pray out loud. Begin your time of prayer by
          speaking God’s name aloud several times. You might say Lord or Jesus or some other name
          you’ve heard used for God such as Shepherd, Warrior, Creator, or Comforter. Ask God to
          teach you more about Himself and how He wants to be part of your life. Let God know that
          you aren’t calling to ask Him to do things your way but, in agreement with who He is, you
          want to be part of His plan for the world and for your future.</p>

          eating a meal, or when you climb stairs. Choose something that happens multiple times each
