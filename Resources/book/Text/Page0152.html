    	  <p class="Body">Just as quickly as Peter became the hero of the day through his understanding of Jesus’ identity as Messiah, his misunderstanding of the role of Messiah instantly made him a hindrance to God’s mission. In that moment the Rock that was meant to be a foundation for Jesus’ message became a stumbling block. Peter learned in that moment that his words not only could make him a mouthpiece for God; they also could make him a tool of Satan, a stumbling block standing in the way of the very calling that Jesus had come to earth to fulfill.</p>

      <p class="Body">That had to be a low blow, going from your Savior calling you Rock to referring to you as Satan. The noun and proper name Satan is actually derived from a Hebrew verb meaning “to obstruct” or “to oppose.” When Peter thought he was doing Jesus a favor by telling him he would never suffer and die in such a horrible manner, he was actually obstructing Jesus’ path, putting himself in the way of Jesus’ ultimate purpose on earth.</p>

      <p class="Body">And that’s only the first time in Scripture that we see Peter reverting back to his old ways.</p>

      <p class="Body">At the Last Supper, in a shocking act of servanthood, Jesus offered to wash the disciples’ feet. Instead of celebrating the moment or waiting to see what Jesus might be trying to teach him, Peter recoiled and rebuked Jesus: “‘No!’ [he] said. ‘You will never wash my feet!’” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.13.8')">John 13:8</span> CEB).</p>

      <p class="Body">Note that when Jesus explained His purpose in washing their feet, Peter begged for Jesus to wash all of him (<span onclick="biblepop('John.13.9')">John 13:9</span>). Again his impulsivity brought to light both the worst and the best in his heart.</p>

      <p class="Body">You may have noticed that the Bible often uses Peter’s old and new names interchangeably, even after Jesus elevated him to rocklike status with his name change. The truth is that sometimes Peter lived up to his new name. Other times he acted more like his pre-Jesus self. At those times Jesus called him Simon, pointing out that he was acting like his old self and not the Rock that Jesus had called him to become.</p>
