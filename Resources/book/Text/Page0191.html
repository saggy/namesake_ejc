      <p class="Body">My friend Amanda grew up going to church every time the doors were unlocked. Her family never missed a Sunday unless they were on vacation. She sang in the youth choir and was a leader in her youth group, and her parents taught Sunday school and led many of the ministries. When she graduated, she decided to attend junior college and live at home for a couple of years while working on a nursing degree. No one was surprised that she chose such a selfless profession. Everyone kept telling her they were so proud and had high expectations for her future.</p>

      <p class="Body">When Amanda found out she was pregnant at age nineteen, one of her first thoughts was “What will everyone think?” Her sense of personal shame was made even stronger by the feeling that she had let so many people down. When she told her parents, they responded with love and tears, promising to stand by her and help her raise the baby. Even so, she couldn’t bring herself to go back to church. She was so worried that everyone was talking about her that once the news of her pregnancy was out, she didn’t even drive by the church, much less go in or worship. She avoided her friends and community for months, figuring they would judge her for her mistakes.</p>

      <p class="Body">One day Amanda’s mom called from church, saying her car wouldn’t start. She asked her to come and pick her up after a meeting. When she got there, Amanda texted her mom to tell her that she was in the parking lot, and her mom texted back, asking her to come in and meet her inside. Taking a deep breath, Amanda walked through the doors of the church that had once been a second home to her. As she waddled her eight-months-pregnant frame down the hallway, so many memories came flooding back. By the time she pushed open the door of the fellowship hall, she was almost in tears. She was confused when the scene she walked in on wasn’t a meeting but a baby shower. “Surprise!” the women of the church shouted, gathering around to hug her and fawn over her with compliments and questions about her plans for the new baby. Amanda blushed, then cried, then sat down and had a piece of cake. She felt like she had come home.</p>

      <p class="Body">I’m thankful that Amanda was mistaken about her church family’s reaction. She expected judgment but received welcome with open arms. But I don’t wonder where her worries came from. I’m afraid there are lots of reasons she might have expected a harsh reaction from God’s people. We haven’t always been so gracious.</p>

      <p class="Body">The woman dragged into the Temple that day with Jesus was put in that precarious position not by troublemakers off the street but by religious insiders. When she was at her most vulnerable, it was followers of God who wounded her with words and actions of judgment. In their effort to take care that God’s laws were followed, they had forgotten to take care not to hurt God’s children.</p>
