<p class="Body">The outward traits of someone who has been transformed by God are often called the fruit of the Spirit. These nine traits may seem like small characteristics, but when they grow in a life with God’s help, they shine powerfully. The fruit of the Spirit grows as you live your life surrendered to God’s Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">I love powerful stories of people whose lives were changed by Jesus in a big way. A friend of mine was lost in addiction, hit rock bottom, and found forgiveness and sobriety. A woman I know was angry and bitter, hurting those around her without a second thought. When she met Jesus, her family and coworkers saw an instant, dramatic change in her. One man lived a life shaped by greed, ignoring his close relationships so he could work to attain more and more material things. When God changed his heart, he became one of the most generous people I know.</p>
