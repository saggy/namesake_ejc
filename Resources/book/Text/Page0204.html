    	  <p class="Body">The truly shocking thing that happened that day is not that Jesus wasn’t named Joseph Jr. It’s that God Himself offered humanity a chance to be on a first-name basis with Him. Jesus, “God Saves,” is His name and His job description all rolled into one. And Jesus fulfilled His name on the cross and through His resurrection when He proved once and for all that God saves.</p>

      <p class="Body">Through His Son, Jesus, God offers you the chance to approach Him on a first-name basis. That ultimate revelation of who God is and how close to us He desires to be alters our understanding of Him in a spectacular way. What a change from God’s people being afraid even to address Him out loud. “Call me Jesus.” Thank God He invites us to that kind of closeness with Him.</p>

      <p class="Body">Names are spoken over us at intimate, holy moments in life because they represent the essence of who we are. And throughout our lives, our names come to embody who we are, both the mundane and sacred parts of our lives. Whether your name is spoken in casual conversation or a sacred rite, it is special because it describes who you are.</p>

      <p class="Body">God has a new name that He wants to speak over you, one that is different from the name you received at birth, different from the nicknames you’ve been called or the titles you’ve received. This new name replaces all the unspoken, hurtful labels you’ve been carrying around and drowns out the inner voices calling you names that are unfit for a child of God. Scripture tells us this naming ceremony is private and personal.</p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read <span onclick="biblepop('Rev.2.17')">Revelation 2:17</span>. Who will receive a new name, and who will this name be known to?</span></p>

    	  <div class="answer" id="p204la1" onclick="answer(this)"question="Read Revelation 2:17. Who will receive a new name, and who will this name be known to?"></div>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">A new name is a gift. It’s a new identity that can come only from knowing the One who created you, the One who knew you before anyone else. Knowing the great I <span class="char-style-override-14">am</span> has changed who I am. God’s revelation of who He is has brought about transformation in my own life. I pray this will be true for you, too. Won’t you allow the God of the universe’s unconditional love and continual care for you to transform the way you see yourself and what you call yourself? God invites you to a first-name relationship with Him, and He has a beautiful name waiting just for you!</p>
