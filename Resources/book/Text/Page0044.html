        <p class="Body" id="p44p6">As a pastor, I find it’s always an amazing privilege to baptize people,
          whether adults or little children. When we are baptizing children, we always begin the
          ceremony by asking the parents a simple question: “What name is given this child?” In
          answering, the parents are given a chance to state the child’s name out loud to their
          community of faith. They are introducing the child publicly into a new family and
          declaring aloud the name they have chosen, the name by which this child will be known by
          family and friends and by God Himself.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p44p7">In reality, parents answer the question “What name is given this child?” far
          more times than once. There is, of course, the moment they have to fill out an official
          birth certificate, but after that there will be countless opportunities to speak words
          over the child that will mark his or her future with either hope and promise or
          disappointment and despair. There are proper names we all go by, but there also are names
          that are hidden—seldom spoken descriptions that we receive branded on some internal
          nametag.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p44p8">In some families, children are marked with beautiful, positive words that
          will help them grow in confidence. In others, they are scarred with words that will become
          unofficial nicknames of negativity, names that brand them in ways they will struggle with
          for a long time. If we’re honest, most of our families have given us both.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p44p9">I’ve watched a child in a tutoring program struggle over his homework,
          coming to a problem he could not answer and whisper to himself as he put his head down on
          the paper, “Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.” That name came from someone, somewhere. And it
          stuck.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p44p10">I’ve seen my husband fumble and drop something in the kitchen and heard the
          first word that popped out of his mouth: “Clumsy!”</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p44p11">I’ve struggled, too, looking in the mirror on those
          days when the skinny jeans just wouldn’t fit (OK, let’s be honest, when the not-so-skinny
          jeans wouldn’t<img src="../../images/rarr.png"></p>
