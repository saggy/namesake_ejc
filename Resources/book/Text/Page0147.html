        <p class="Body" i="19">Simon was transparent, honest, and personal in his response. Instead of
          speaking from a carefully measured academic lecture or religious sermon, he spoke from his
          heart. And he acknowledged that Jesus was the One he personally had been waiting for, the
          One who was changing His life and could change the world. Jesus rewarded Simon with a
          response that must have stunned the other disciples:</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-47" i="21">
          <span class="char-style-override-17" i="22">Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah,
            for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that
            you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades</span>
          <span class="char-style-override-17" i="23">will not overcome it.”</span>

        <p class="Body" i="30">The name Simon means “He Hears and Obeys.” This name had hung around his
          neck like an oversized sweater that never quite fit. He never really listened much. He was
          too busy blurting out the first thing on his mind. And obedience? That continued to be a
          struggle for him throughout the Gospel stories.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="32">

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="35">The name Peter means “Rock, Boulder.” It describes a
          solid foundation. At first it doesn’t seem any more appropriate than the name he had
          before. But what Jesus says next tells us something about His reasoning for choosing this
          impetuous follower to lead the pack.</p>
