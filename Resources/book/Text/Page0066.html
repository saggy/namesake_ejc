    <p class="Body" id="p66p9" i="22">The name others use when addressing me is a gift I’ve offered them, something I have given them unspoken permission to use. It often reveals the depth of our relationship or the role I play in their lives, and they in mine. It also reveals the type of authority or influence they have over me. Whether we realize it or not, the name we give someone to call us and the way in which the person says it is a defining part of our connection—relational currency to be spent wisely.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p66p10" i="23">What name does God give us to address Him? The answer tells us so much about how He wants our relationship to play out. Are we supposed to hold Him at arm’s length, put Him on an unreachable pedestal, or treat Him like a casual acquaintance?</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p66p11" i="24">As we saw yesterday, the night that Jacob wrestled with God, he demanded to know his opponent’s name. But if we look beyond the surface, we discover that this wasn’t a request for a formal introduction: “Hey there, I’m Jacob. And you are . . . ?” Actually, it was a not-so-subtle move toward checkmate, an attempt at domination. Asking his opponent’s name was the same as asking his wrestling partner to cry “uncle!” Since a name contained someone’s essence, the heart of his or her story, knowing someone’s true name meant having a measure of authority and control over him or her. To be able to call someone by name meant having a sense of familiarity and power. Jacob wanted his opponent’s name because he wanted to win.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p66p12" i="25">Even in this Divine encounter in Genesis 32, when Jacob was given one more chance at redemption and rebirth, he had the audacity to try to grab one more thing for himself: the name of God.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p66p13" i="26">If you flip forward to the next book of the Bible, Exodus, you’ll find Moses also in the middle of a desperate encounter with God. At the burning bush God called Moses to lead God’s people out of slavery in Egypt and into a beautiful and plentiful Promised Land. When God gave him his marching orders, Moses knew better than to go back and stand in front of the crowd of Israelites without some credentials. He knew they would ask “Who sent you? Who commanded you to do this?” Moses needed some clout. He needed to be able to communicate to the people that the One who was spinning this audacious plan would have the power to carry it out, that the One who was calling them would also lead them. Moses actually needed to be reassured of this more than anyone! If God’s people<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="27"></p>
