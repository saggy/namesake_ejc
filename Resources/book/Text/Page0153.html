    	 <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="17">Simon Peter is a hybrid of his two names, which also appears in Scripture, reminding us (and him) that transformation doesn’t happen overnight—that often we are living with both our old nature and our new hope, all in one self.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="18">When it comes to transformation in our lives, most of us would love a microwave solution, one where we could watch change unfolding quickly through a little window. Sometimes that happens. I’ve known people who have experienced freedom from a lifelong temptation or have been transformed in just one moment. More often though, God works with us in the slow movement of grace that takes a lifetime.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="19">Sometimes we have the idea that a life committed to Christ will be instantly better. This leads people to the expectation that the moment their lives are in Jesus’ hands, they won’t struggle anymore—that their flaws will melt away and their temptations will fade. That way of thinking is similar to the idea that many people have about marriage—that saying “I do” will automatically transform the couple into new persons. We say it all the time: “You just need to find someone and settle down,” as if getting married will automatically settle you down—make you more stable, more dependable, more mature. A lot of people find out the hard way that the only thing getting married makes you is married. You have to work at the growing up part together.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="20">Likewise, the only thing giving your life to Christ makes you is a Christian. All the same temptations, all the same struggles, all the same character flaws that drove you into the arms of Christ will follow you there. The difference is that Jesus is there to help you with all of it. Jesus is the One with the power to enable each of us to live a transformed life.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="21">Sanctification, the process of change that makes us more and more like Jesus, is more like a slow cooker than a microwave. Even as we walk with God, we sometimes will fall down again, often in the same potholes we fell into before. But there is always hope and grace and forgiveness. Thank God He has the patience and grace to work on us over the long haul, when we would have given up on ourselves long ago.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="22"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="23"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="24">Where do you see “slow-cooker change” in your own life?</span></p>
       	  
       	  <div class="answer" id="a25" onclick="answer(this)" question="Where do you see “slow-cooker change” in your own life?" i="25"></div>

      <p class="Body" i="26"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="27">How has God helped you to change over time?</span></p>

  <div class="answer" id="a28" onclick="answer(this)" question="How has God helped you to change over time?" i="28"></div>

      <p class="Body" i="29">The change is there, though it may be barely perceptible at times. We’d like to see a lightning-fast transformation. But we need to remember that the process of change we are going through is as important as the end result itself.</p>
