      <p class="noindentp" id="p8p1">You and a group of friends will see that God wants to be just as intimately involved in <i>your</i> stories, offering each of you an identity that shines with the purpose for which you were created—to know Him through His Son, Jesus, and to become more and more like Him, bringing God glory for His name’s sake.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p2">In addition to discovering how God works to bring this transformation in our lives, you also will explore how God has revealed Himself to us in Scripture—and how He desires to reveal Himself personally to each and every one of us. He is a God who reveals and transforms. My prayer is that you will come to know Him in a deeper and more personal way as you invite Him to rewrite your own life story, allowing His dreams for you to come true.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Transformation and Revelation</h3>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p3">Each week in your reading you’ll find the themes of <i>transformation</i> and <i>revelation</i>. Let’s take a closer look at these themes and what they have to do with God’s dreams for us.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transformation</span> is true and remarkable change. It’s what happens when something is no longer its old self but becomes something else. All of the people we will encounter in our journey together experienced transformation at God’s hands.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p5">God is not only great at creating (from scratch); He’s great at transforming. When His creation goes astray, He doesn’t walk away or shake His head in disgust. He rolls up His sleeves and gets down to the business of transformation. He nudges, whispers, shouts, pulls, and prompts until we get the picture of what He desires for us to become. And then He gently helps us get there.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p6">Through transformation God declares: “Behold, I am making all things new” (<span onclick="biblepop('Rev.21.5')">Revelation 21:5</span> NASB).</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p7"><b>Revelation</b> is more than just the name of the last book of the Bible. Revelation is the noun that happens when you reveal something. Revelation is what God does from beginning to end in Scripture. He reveals Himself and His character to His people again and again, ultimately coming to us in human form through Jesus so that we might truly know Him and how He feels about us.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p8">When we know who He is, our understanding of who we are and what we are about shifts dramatically. All true transformation starts with revelation, not about ourselves, but about the One who has the power to show us who we are and change us into whom we are called to be.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p9">Through revelation God declares: “I <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">am who</span> I <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">am</span>” (<span onclick="biblepop('Exod.3.14')">Exodus 3:14</span>).</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p8p10">Throughout our study we’ll be bouncing back and forth between the questions “Who is God?” and “Who is God calling me to become?” These questions are so related that the attempt to answer one will always lead us to ask the other. The six stories from the Bible we will study together will help illustrate six different times<img src="../../images/rarr.png"></p>
