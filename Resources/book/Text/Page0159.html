      <p class="Body" i="20">Sifting wheat is an act of separating the useful part (kernel) from the junk (chaff). The whole of the wheat is shaken in a sieve. The good kernels stay firmly in the mesh while the chaff either falls through the cracks or flies up and floats away, too light to stay firmly planted with the pieces of substance. Sifting implies separating the good from the bad, the substance from the rubbish.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="21">The interesting thing here is that the “you” in both of these sentences is plural. Where I’m from, we would translate it “y’all.” Jesus was talking about all of the disciples in these two sentences, not just Peter. Here’s the Texas translation: “Satan has asked to sift y’all like wheat. But I have prayed for y’all, Simon, that your faith may not fail.”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="22">Peter puffed himself up with characteristic bravado and declared that he was ready to face prison or even death for Jesus’ sake. He was asserting that he would never be the one to betray Jesus, to turn away from his loyalty, to disappoint the Savior he loved. Jesus knew better.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="36">Peter’s disappointing behavior was not a surprise to Jesus. It didn’t catch Him off guard. It didn’t make Him love Peter any less. Jesus actually reached out in grace before Peter ever sinned, praying for Peter and the other disciples because He knew the toughest test of their faith—the crucifixion and death of the Savior they followed—lay only hours ahead of them.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="37">Jesus knew that Peter would disappoint Him by denying Him. But He also knew that Peter wouldn’t stay down long. He prayed that this moment of struggle would be one that would strengthen Peter, and that when He bounced back He would strengthen His brothers as well.</p>
