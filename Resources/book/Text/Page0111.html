        <p class="Body" i="15">When we’re little, our moms seem like know-it-alls. They are the ones in
          control. They seem to hold all the cards, and they always know what they’re doing. Imagine
          my surprise when I became a mom myself to learn that when they hand you your baby for the
          first time, they don’t hand you the secrets that all moms know, the instructions for what
          to do at every moment, or the answers to all the questions your children will
          ask.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="Body" i="16">On the first night home from the hospital with our first baby, I kicked all
          the relatives out of the house, imagining our sweet little family of three bonding all
          alone together. Let’s just say that night convinced me of how much I had to learn.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="17">The surprises definitely didn’t end in the newborn phase. Lately I’m baffled
          that I thought parenting one tiny baby was so difficult. Now that he has grown into the
          toddler trying to run our household, his everyday antics make taking care of his infant
          sister seem like a piece of cake! Someday I’m sure I will have two teenagers and look back
          and wonder what all the fuss was about when they were tiny.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="18">Parenting is not for the faint of heart! Running a multimillion-dollar
          corporation, or a country, is less challenging on some days (not to mention nights) than
          parenting small children.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="19">Not only do our children start out in the world
          physically helpless, dependent on us for their needs of nourishment and safety and
          shelter; they also are a behavioral and social blank slate. They need to be indoctrinated
          into the family’s culture: the expectations of how family members are to treat one
          another, behave at the table, speak or wait to be called on, and generally function in
          this particular group of people. We begin teaching our children about the family’s culture
          from the first day they are born. Even newborns receive messages about how structured or
          chaotic, loud or quiet, loving or distant the family’s culture will be. Families teach
          some of the same lessons, but each of our families is unique in some ways, with its own
          values, standards, and habits that make it special. Your own family, for example, may have
          communicated the importance of getting an education, appreciating music or nature, serving
          the poor, or respecting the wisdom of elders.</p>
