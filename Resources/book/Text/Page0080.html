        <p class="Body" id="p80p3" i="20">God wants to know our hearts and have us express ourselves honestly. As with
          achieving intimacy in any healthy human relationship, we can’t be truly close to God in
          good times unless we are truly transparent with Him in bad times as well. If you’re
          wondering how God reacts when His people accuse Him of sending them pain and punishment,
          we will explore that in Day 4 as we continue reading about Naomi’s life. For now, know
          that instead of turning away from her in her grief or leaving her to stew in her own
          bitterness, God continued to offer her His grace and love. Even if we turn our backs on
          God, we can be assured that He never turns His back on us.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p80p4" i="21">We will see that Scripture never condemns Naomi’s anger at God and that God
          doesn’t withhold any future goodness or blessing from her life just because she was angry
          with Him. Thankfully, there’s a lot more to Naomi’s story than this first chapter! But
          she’s already taught us an important lesson. It’s OK to be honest with God. In fact, He
          invites us to share our deepest struggles with Him. He wants to be part of both the good
          and bad parts of our life. When we’re feeling discouraged, it’s important to remember
          there are still many chapters to be written in our own stories as well.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p80p5" i="22">When I remember the details of the Christmas now frozen in grief in my mind,
          I remember not just the shock or the odd details that stuck in my memory. I also remember,
          looking back, that God was there with us in that moment. That very word, <span class="char-style-override-17" i="23">remember</span>, means “to put back together.” Our
          members may be torn from us by grief in a moment, but God walks with us through the
          difficult moments, hours, years that follow, helping us put the pieces of our hearts back
          together so we can breathe again. When we feel lost or forgotten, God remembers us.</p>
