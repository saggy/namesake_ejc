      <p style="text-align: justify;">I hope you’ll be listening for the echoes of your own story each week. Exploring our identities is a lifelong process. At every stage and in every experience of life we are led to ask again: “Who is God, and who is He calling me to become?”</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Getting Started</h3>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">For each week of our study there are five readings. The first four explore the theme of transformation found in the featured Bible story, and the last one focuses on the theme of God’s revelation of Himself. Each of these readings includes the following segments:</p>

      <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">
            <p class="noindent"><b>Read God's Word</b></p>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">
            <p class="noindent">A portion of the Bible story for the week, occasionally with other Scripture readings.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">
            <p class="noindent"><b>Reflect and Respond</b></p>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">
            <p class="noindent">A guided reflection and study of the Scripture with space for recording your responses. (Boldface type indicates write-in-the-book questions or activities.)</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">
            <p class="noindent"><b>Pray About It</b></p>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">
            <p class="noindent">A prayer suggestion and/or sample prayer to guide you into a personal time of prayer.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td nowrap="nowrap" valign="top">
            <p class="noindent"><b>Act on It</b></p>
          </td>

          <td valign="top">
            <p class="noindent">Ideas to help you act on what you have read.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">You will be able to complete each reading in about 20–30 minutes. (You will need a pen or pencil and your Bible.) Completing these readings each week will help to prepare you for the discussion and activities of the group session.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">Once a week you will gather with your group to watch a video in which I share additional insights into the stories and their application in our lives. I encourage you to discuss what you’re learning and to share how God is working to transform your own stories. You will find that sharing with one another will enable you to recognize God’s activity in your lives even more clearly and help you to encourage and pray for one another.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">Before you begin this journey, give God permission to work on your heart and your life. Offer yourself to Him and express your desire to live into the new story He is writing for you. May God richly bless you as you study His Word and discover the wonderful things that happen when God rewrites your story!</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>

      <p style="text-align: right;">Blessings,</p><img alt="" src="../Images/authorsig.png" style="float:right" /></div>
