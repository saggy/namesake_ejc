        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Reflect and Respond</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p12p3">I’ve always been intrigued by the stories behind people’s names. When someone is introduced to me by name, I often find myself on a scavenger hunt of questions to find out if it has an anecdote attached to it. Harper—Is that a family name? Boston—Is that city a special place for your family? I’m truly curious about names, but sometimes people look at me as if I’m a little too nosy! Most people love to tell their story. Sometimes they have a clear namesake— someone whose name was passed down to them in hopes they would carry on some characteristic or attribute. Other times parents seem to have chosen a name at random. I’ve known more than one couple who arrived at the hospital for the birth of their child without knowing what they would write on the birth certificate. One couple even put their list up on the wall of the delivery room and let the medical staff vote!</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p12p4">One set of parents I know used to try out potential names for their unborn children by attaching titles to the end to see how they sounded. Piper Johnson, Attorney at Law. Reginald Johnson, M.D. If the name seemed to fit the dream they had for their child, they would put it on their short list.</p>
