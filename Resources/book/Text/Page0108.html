        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="25">From the time she was a teenager, Erika knew that she wanted to adopt a 
child someday. “Every kid needs a family,” she reasoned. Even after giving birth 
to three children, Erika found that the longing to adopt still hadn’t subsided, so 
she approached her husband, Barry, with the idea of adding a fourth child to 
their family. Barry wasn’t as certain. Adoption would mean years of paperwork 
followed by a lot of adjustments to their already full life.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="26">One weekend they attended church as usual, unaware that the guest speaker 
would be highlighting the great need for families willing to adopt. He talked 
about God’s heart for orphans and encouraged people to open their hearts and 
homes to give these children a place to grow up surrounded by love. By the time 
they were in the car on the way home from church, Barry and Erika were on the 
same page at last, asking God to bring them a child that needed a home.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="27">As a family, they determined that to meet a need, they should go to the place 
on earth with the greatest need. So they decided on Ethiopia. Ethiopia has a 
population of about 80 million, and because it has been hit so hard by the AIDS 
epidemic, there are about 5 million orphans.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="28">Barry and Erika began talking and praying with their children about the little 
boy they were hoping to adopt. In their conversations they called him Daniel, 
imagining the little brother who was waiting for them halfway around the world. 
When they finally received their confirmation letter, their son’s picture and a 
name were included. His Ethiopian name was Hiyab (pronounced HEE-ab), one 
that none of them had even heard of before. “A lot of kids get renamed when 
they come home to the United States,” Erika said. But when they learned the 
story behind the name, they immediately knew: “There’s no way we can change 
that!”</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" i="29">Hiyab’s birth parents met as teenagers, both of them Ethiopian Orthodox 
Christians. They moved to the big city of Addis Ababa but split up. They reunited<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="30"></p>
