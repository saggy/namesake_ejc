    	 <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="13">When Jesus said that the truth will set us free, He wasn’t referring to a mystical or philosophical truth. The truth He was talking about was in the context of a conversation about our own sinful actions and our slavery to them. A continual focus on the sins of others is hurtful not only to them but also to us, because it puts blinders on our eyes and keeps us from seeing the truth about ourselves. And recognition of that truth is the only thing that will drive us to confession and forgiveness, the true place of freedom.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="14">I met Amanda and became her friend and her pastor years after the surprise baby shower. She told me that story one day as we sat at a church potluck dinner. As we talked, her five-year-old son, Conner, ran circles around that same fellowship hall where the shower had been held. He was as happy and energetic as any five-year-old, stopping to grab a bite off his mom’s plate, to get a quick hug from his grandparents, to be tickled by the dad in the family at the table on one side of us, and to exchange a joke with the kids at the table on the other side. All the time he was unaware of the grace running as a current through that room: the grace that was a gift to his mother and now to him as well; the gift of a family of faith that had refused to point a finger but instead welcomed with open arms.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="19">When Jesus asked for the person without sin in the crowd of accusers to identify himself, no hand went up. That’s still true today, isn’t it? You and I both know that if we suppress the temptation to keep score in other people’s lives long enough to look carefully at our own, we will find a record that is far from perfect. But the good news is that the one sinless heart in the crowd, the heart of Christ, is not one that throws stones at our sin. While others hurl judgment, He offers grace. If you’ll let that simple truth sink in, it will dramatically change the way you see others—and yourself.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="24"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="25">Loving God, show me the areas where I am tempted to point a finger at others. Give me new eyes to see them the way You see them, and to react to their mistakes with Your grace and mercy. When You give me the gift of being convicted for my own sins, help me to look on my heart with the same gentleness Jesus had for the unnamed woman. Teach me to put down the stones I throw at others and the ones I throw at myself. Make me a part of shaping Your church as a place of welcome and forgiveness. Amen.</span></p>
