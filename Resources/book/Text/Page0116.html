They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.”</span></p>

So these men were brought before the king,</span> <span class="text-dan-3-14 char-style-override-18">14</span><span class="text-dan-3-14 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up?</span> <span class="text-dan-3-15 char-style-override-18">15</span><span class="text-dan-3-15 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-dan-3-16 char-style-override-18">16</span><span class="text-dan-3-16 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter.</span> <span class="text-dan-3-17 char-style-override-18">17</span><span class="text-dan-3-17 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king.</span> <span class="text-dan-3-18 char-style-override-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="text-dan-3-18 char-style-override-17">But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.”</span></p>

He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual</span> <span class="text-dan-3-20 char-style-override-18">20</span><span class="text-dan-3-20 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.</span> <span class="text-dan-3-21 char-style-override-18">21</span><span class="text-dan-3-21 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.</span> <span class="text-dan-3-22 char-style-override-18">22</span><span class="text-dan-3-22 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego,</span> <span class="text-dan-3-23 char-style-override-18">23</span><span class="text-dan-3-23 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace.</span></p>
