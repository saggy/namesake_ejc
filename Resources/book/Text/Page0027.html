        <p class="Body" id="p27p4">While Abraham and Sarah were used to making their own promises to idols that
          were false and powerless, they suddenly found themselves in the presence of the God who
          was powerful and true—who took ownership of the outcome and made clear that He would be
          the power behind these great works by over and over again using the words “I will” to
          describe His intentions to fulfill this new covenant.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p27p5">
          <span>This God is clearly not one to be manipulated and controlled like an idol but is the
            One in control. The promises made are to fulfill His will and purpose. As for an
            itinerary or timeline, God is not exact on that point. He just points to a time in the
            future and says, “I will.” I’m sure Abraham and Sarah were thrilled at the prospect of
            such great gifts arriving in their lives, while also wishing for a little more detail
            about how and when they would arrive! I can identify. I often wish God would spell out
            details about my future instead of expecting me to trust Him.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="Body" id="p27p6">Letting God be in control is a hard thing, but the fulfillment of His
          promises is so much better than looking to our own devices or fruitlessly worshipping the
          false gods of this world to try to get our desires met in our own timing. God’s continual
          promise “I will” means that the responsibility and power for our lives lies in His hands,
          not our own.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p27p7">If you’ll look back closely at your own story, I’m sure you’ll find it is
          marked by so many gifts that have already arrived: people who have brought you laughter,
          places that you’ve treasured, and most of all a presence—His presence.</p>
