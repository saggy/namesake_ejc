        <p style="text-align: justify;">When I arrived at the hospital having contractions at the end of my second 
pregnancy, I was very excited when the doctor told me that, yes, this was really 
labor and, yes, I would be having a baby girl today. My second favorite news 
of the morning was when the doctor told me that I could get my epidural. My 
contractions were in full force, and the epidural is my favorite part of having 
a baby (I’m not joking). Seeing new life come into the world is great, but the 
epidural. . . . Whoever invented it is definitely the greatest inventor who ever 
lived—next to the person who discovered chocolate.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">For some reason, the sweet anesthesiologist thought it would be a good idea for 
Jim to stay in the room, sit on a stool facing me, and hold my hand while I got the 
epidural—you know, to comfort me. Here are some facts that might have changed 
that decision. Fact one: I have a medical background and a great fondness for the 
epidural (previously mentioned), and I was not in the slightest need of comfort. 
Fact two: That is one huge needle going into your spine. Fact three: Jim has sometimes been known to pass out when giving blood, something that requires a much 
smaller needle and a situation with nowhere near as much stress and excitement.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">So, as the nice doctor was placing a needle into a place inches away from where 
it could cause paralysis, I stared into my husband’s eyes as his face turned white, 
his eyes rolled back in his head, the stool rolled out from under him, and his head 
made a loud knocking sound while connecting with the hospital floor. All the 
while the nice doctor with the needle in my back was screaming in my ear: “Do 
not move! Do not move!” (Note: If you ever meet my husband, please don’t mock 
him. He was kind enough to give permission for me to write about this!)</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Suddenly the entire emergency response team was in the room with us, 
and I wasn’t the patient everyone was most concerned about.  Jim regained 
consciousness immediately, but the medical staff insisted that he make a trip to 
the emergency room for a CAT scan. I agreed we were better safe than sorry, so 
off he went to give our hospital bills a creative addendum.</p>
