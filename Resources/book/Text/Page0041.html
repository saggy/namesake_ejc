Nakusa and invited the girls to imagine a new future without the shame of being 
unwanted. These girls were reshaping their lives and choosing new futures by 
choosing new names. Some of the Nakusas wanted to be named after Bollywood 
stars, like Aishwarya. Others chose traditional names like Vaishali, which means 
“Prosperous, Beautiful, and Good.”</p><p id="p41p2" i="14">
    	 </p><p style="text-align: justify;" id="p41p3" i="15">One fifteen-year-old Nakusa chose to be renamed Ashmita, which means 
“Very Tough” or “Rock Hard” in Hindi. She commented, “Now in school, my 
classmates and friends will be calling me this new name, and that makes me very 
happy.”<sup i="16">1</sup>
 She clearly had survived events and attitudes that made her tough as 
nails. Now her name would reflect that.</p><p id="p41p4" i="17">

girls who refuse to believe what they are called is a beautiful picture of hope. Just 
as they chose new names and new lives in one instant, we are not doomed to be 
named by our pasts. No matter what we have been called or how we have been 
treated, God longs to speak names over us that communicate His acceptance and 
delight in who we are. In His eyes we are treasured children, waiting to receive 
our new names that tell us just how wanted we truly are.</p><p id="p41p6" i="19">

with a name that he believed and lived out for many years. He hurt those he 
loved, stole what was not his, and ultimately had to flee for his life. But God had 
another plan, and in a renaming ceremony of His own, set Jacob on a new course 
in life.</p><p id="p41p8" i="21">

we start out with in life. When we enter into relationship with Jesus, we are proclaimed a “new creation”—followed by the assurance that “the old has gone, the 
new is here!” (<span onclick="biblepop('2Cor.5.17')" i="23">2 Corinthians 5:17</span>). God is in the business of offering us renaming 
ceremonies of our own. In His eyes, none of us is unwanted.</p><p id="p41p10" i="24">
