          Sarah’s attention because it addressed a long-awaited desire of their hearts: a family.
          God promised not only a little bundle they could call their own but also a family that
          would be as plentiful as the stars in the heavens or the grains of sand on the shore. This
          would result not just in a little nuclear family but also in a people, one that would be
          blessed by God and share His blessings with the world. The “people” promised here were the
          beginning of a family line. God’s chosen people. God promised that He would bring
          blessings to Abraham’s offspring.</p>
