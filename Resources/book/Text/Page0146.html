    	 <p class="Body">The biblical authors couldn’t resist listing Judas last every time. In the lists from three of the Gospels, they give away the end of the story by telling us from the very moment the disciples are chosen that Judas will betray Jesus. Acts doesn’t name him at all since his story had already come to an end.</p>

      <p class="Body">The first group of disciples is the list of the four who were closest to Jesus—two sets of brothers who were the first disciples Jesus called. And always at the top of that list, always named first in the first group, is Simon Peter. His position at the top of the list marks him as the leader and spokesperson of the disciples. The rough, impetuous fisherman is an unlikely but clear selection to lead the disciples and the future church.</p>

      <p class="Body">Simon leads the group in many of the Gospel stories. Sometimes his leadership is intentional, planned, and strategic. Sometimes it seems almost accidental—an inadvertent byproduct of his reckless, impulsive nature. Sometimes the other disciples seem to hang back, letting Simon stick his neck out and take the risks they don’t want to take.</p>

      <p class="Body">Although his risky behavior sometimes gets him in trouble, there are times when he lands on the right answer, almost by accident. Never was that more true than on the day that Jesus changed Simon’s name. Jesus was giving His disciples a pop quiz. He first asked them: “Who do others say that I am?” It was easy to tell Jesus what they had overheard from the crowds of people around them.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Once they had passed the easy portion of the test, Jesus asked them: “Who do <span class="char-style-override-17">you</span> say that I am?” It was one of those questions that required them to think about all they had heard and seen in their time with Jesus, to put the facts together, and then to create an answer that matched their experiences, observations, beliefs, and feelings about Jesus. They all hesitated at that point. All of them, that is, except Simon.</p>

      <p class="Body">I doubt that Simon stopped to think about what the other disciples would think or if he had the right answer or an answer that Jesus would like. In keeping with his impulsive nature, he probably went with his gut and simply reacted.</p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('Matt.16.16')">Matthew 16:16</span> and fill in the blanks:</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-23">Simon Peter answered, “You are the ______________, the __________ of the living __________.”</span> <span class="char-style-override-21">(NIV)</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body">No one had told Simon that Jesus was the Messiah (the Christ), the One that all of Israel had awaited for so long. He seemed to blurt it out in a moment of passion. And for once it was just the right thing to say.</p>

      <p class="Body">Jesus isn’t interested in what we’ve overheard about Him from others. He wants to know what we think and believe about Him ourselves. You can tell Jesus what your parents say about Him, what your pastors and church leaders<img src="../../images/rarr.png"></p>
