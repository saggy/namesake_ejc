        <p class="Body" id="p84p5" i="22">With these words, Ruth is forming a covenant friendship with Naomi. Their
          connection as a family was severed by the death of Ruth’s husband, Naomi’s son. Ruth’s
          covenant reinstates the bonds of family between them. Stronger than a contract, a covenant
          has at its center the God they will both worship and follow. They’ll need God’s strength
          to carry them through the difficult days ahead.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p84p6" i="23">God often provides us with strength in a very real and physical way by
          providing us with each other for support. The spiritual is made real in the tangible,
          loving support of the people of God in our lives.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p84p10" i="32">Ruth’s poetic words bind her in covenant friendship to Naomi, but they also
          bind her to Naomi’s God. They are not just words of camaraderie; they are words of
          conversion. Where once Naomi and Ruth had shared common love and common grief, now they
          shared a common faith. While it’s important for us to reach out and create friendships
          with nonbelievers, it’s also important for our souls to nurture friendships with others
          who have faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

          one another’s pain.</p>
