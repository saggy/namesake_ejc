    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">daughter’s hand and waiting for a chance to give that driver a piece of his mind. As the bus rounded the corner, he reconsidered for a moment, leaned down, and asked his little girl: “Honey, just what did the bus driver say yesterday?”</p>

      <p class="Body">“You know, daddy. The ‘S word’—the bad one.” And then whispering, she added, “Shut up.”</p>

      <p class="Body">If you’re hearing the voice of condemnation, the one that tells you you’ll never be good enough, never change, never be acceptable to God, then it’s time to tell it to <span class="char-style-override-17">shut up!</span> Because this voice, which often masquerades as the voice of God, is an insidious trick. It drives you farther from the Father, who offers forgiveness for free when we simply recognize our need for Him.</p>

      <p class="Body">But if you’re hearing a voice of conviction, the one that gently corrects, invites you to change, and whispers that there’s a path better than the one you’re headed down, then continue to <span class="char-style-override-17">listen up</span>. God doesn’t point out sin because He’s against you. He is for you and wants to help you change for the better.</p>

      <p class="Body">There is no place for the voice of condemnation in a Christian’s life. The Bible is clear on that point. The Son of God did not come into this world to condemn. There is now, therefore, <span class="char-style-override-17">no</span> condemnation. God doesn’t want us to stay captive to our sin that separates us from Him, but neither does He want us captive to a voice that separates us from Him by telling us we don’t deserve His forgiveness and grace—or that we’re not capable of being better than we have been in the past. That voice is a lie.</p>

      <p class="Body">When we look at Jesus’ interaction with the woman caught in adultery, we don’t find even a hint of condemnation. What we do find is an offer to change with His help, an offer at a life that won’t keep damaging her, an offer to stop being branded by her past. Jesus didn’t want her to be known for the rest of her life as the woman caught in adultery. He wanted to free her from the voice of condemnation and free her from the path that held her captive in the past.</p>

      <p class="Body">I’ve always felt a little frustrated that, like in many other narratives of Jesus’ encounters in Scripture, we don’t know the end of this woman’s story. We don’t know if she took Jesus up on his offer of a new life. Sometimes, though, I think stories like this are open ended so that we can imagine the ending ourselves. Envisioning her ending helps us, in a way, to ask what we want our own endings to be.</p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Imagine what happened in her life if she accepted Jesus’ command to “Go and sin no more.” How would her life be different? How would she feel?</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Now imagine if she didn’t follow Jesus’ words. What would her life be like? How would she feel?</span></p>
