            their history as slaves in Egypt?</span>
        </p>

        <div class="answer" id="p132la1" onclick="answer(this)" question="Why do you think He began by reminding the people of their history as slaves in Egypt?"></div>

        <p class="Body">Exodus 20 reminds us that only God can save, that He brought His people out
          of Egypt, where they were slaves. This reminder is closely connected to the command that
          they should have no other gods and should not make idols. The implication is that when we
          turn to anything but God for help, we are deceiving ourselves, burdening ourselves, and
          separating ourselves from the help and salvation He is so eager to give. The benefits of
          choosing to worship God impact not only our own lives but also trickle down to thousands
          of generations that will follow.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="Body">While our current culture doesn’t often create physical idols to represent
          false gods (statues of clay and wood and bronze), we do have a problem with idol worship.
          We adopt things in our own lives and place them in the seat that God alone should occupy.
          We may take relationships or control, worry or financial resources, jobs or children,
          desires for food or sex, beauty or wealth, and begin to make them the center of our
          thoughts and priorities.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24">The question at the heart of the book of Daniel is
          this: <span class="char-style-override-17">What will you worship?</span></p>

        <p class="Body">Daniel and his three friends are given that choice again and again. Will you
          eat food offered to idols? Will you bow down to a golden statue? Will you pray to the king
          instead of praying daily to the God you love? Each conflict they face, each major choice
          they make, is about choosing whom they will worship.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="Body">The same is true for us. The most basic conflicts of our lives arise when we
          begin to worship things besides God. When we turn our lives over to Him, our most basic
          records (like our checkbook, calendar, and journal) will indicate choices that honor Him,
          decisions we’ve made because we want to be more like Him. His name and His character will
          shine through the line items, daily entries, and appointments, and our lives will reflect
          His joy because of it.</p>
