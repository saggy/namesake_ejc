          Though that may seem strange to us today, in Naomi’s day, the kinsman-redeemer was someone
          highly valued by family members because they could count on him to come to the rescue when
          they were desperate. Besides being a human agent with responsibility to help family
          members, a kinsman-redeemer was also definitely an instrument of God. While the human
          kinsman-redeemer is working in plain sight, the true Redeemer is the one working behind
          the scenes. Scripture is clear about the fact that God is the ultimate Kinsman-Redeemer.
          Any human being who takes on that role is simply showing the world how God comes to our
          rescue when we need His help. Scripture uses the word <span class="char-style-override-17"
            >go’el</span> to describe God as redeemer.</p>
