      <p class="Body" i="16">I wonder if you’ve ever felt the crushing weight of condemnation in your own life. Have you ever felt stuck in a rut of your own behavior or trapped by the mistakes of your past? The story of the unnamed woman is a gift for those of us who long to lead different lives with God’s help. It unveils the beautiful balance Jesus achieves between releasing us from condemnation and offering us responsibility and freedom to choose a different future. That offer stands open for you today!</p>

Thank You for the freedom from the condemning voices of others and even the condemning voice that often sounds inside of our heads. Thank You, also, for offering us freedom from our past sins by calling us to “Go and sin no more.” If there is anything in my life that is keeping me from You through the deception of sin, please bring me the gift of conviction and the desire and strength to offer that sin to You for forgiveness and change. Let me speak words of compassion and not condemnation over those You love, including myself. Amen.</span></p>
