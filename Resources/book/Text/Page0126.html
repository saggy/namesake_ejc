        <p class="Body" i="17">When we are struggling with harsh realities or simply the monotony of daily
          life, praising God is often not at the top of our list of things we feel like doing. But
          our need to worship God does not change with our shifting circumstances. Daniel made
          worship a habit. If we will do the same, we will find that praise grounds us in a reality
          beyond our moods or our situations. Worship gives deep gladness to the heart of God. It
          also grounds us in a reality that is unseen—one that is more true than those before our
          eyes.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="22">Daniel found a place to worship even when it wasn’t convenient or safe. He
          prayed to God when he may have felt very distant from God. This daily practice of prayer
          and worship helped Daniel and his friends keep their faith strong when faced with tough
          choices. Daniel’s prayer life and his ability to stay true to God, continuing to worship
          even when it meant his life was at stake, are intrinsically connected. His continual
          seeking of God’s heart through worship helped him do what was right even when the stakes
          were high.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="30">God knew that worship would be as important to us as
          the air we breathe. When we’re living in an atmosphere that could choke the faith out of
          us, making worship a priority is as important as taking oxygen on a deep-sea diving
          expedition.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="31">The emphasis on worship is found throughout
          Scripture. The Psalms are packed with praise and worship to God. Revelation shines with
          Technicolor images of worship before the lamb on the throne. The book of Exodus dedicates
          thirteen chapters to instructions about the building of the Tabernacle, a traveling center
          of worship for God’s people. The attention given to worship in so many situations in the
          Bible shows us how important worship is to God.</p>
