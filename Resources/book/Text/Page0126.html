    	  <p class="Body">When we are struggling with harsh realities or simply the monotony of daily life, praising God is often not at the top of our list of things we feel like doing. But our need to worship God does not change with our shifting circumstances. Daniel made worship a habit. If we will do the same, we will find that praise grounds us in a reality beyond our moods or our situations. Worship gives deep gladness to the heart of God. It also grounds us in a reality that is unseen—one that is more true than those before our eyes.</p>

      <p class="Body">Daniel found a place to worship even when it wasn’t convenient or safe. He prayed to God when he may have felt very distant from God. This daily practice of prayer and worship helped Daniel and his friends keep their faith strong when faced with tough choices. Daniel’s prayer life and his ability to stay true to God, continuing to worship even when it meant his life was at stake, are intrinsically connected. His continual seeking of God’s heart through worship helped him do what was right even when the stakes were high.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">God knew that worship would be as important to us as the air we breathe. When we’re living in an atmosphere that could choke the faith out of us, making worship a priority is as important as taking oxygen on a deep-sea diving expedition.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">The emphasis on worship is found throughout Scripture. The Psalms are packed with praise and worship to God. Revelation shines with Technicolor images of worship before the lamb on the throne. The book of Exodus dedicates thirteen chapters to instructions about the building of the Tabernacle, a traveling center of worship for God’s people. The attention given to worship in so many situations in the Bible shows us how important worship is to God.</p>
