        <p class="Body" id="p46p2" i="18">The challenge in life is to sort out the names on our internal nametags. We
          need to recognize and accept the names we have been given that God nods and smiles at,
          ones given by people speaking with God’s Spirit and His character. He definitely uses
          people as His mouthpieces to push us forward in life to discover the identity that He has
          created for us.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p46p3" i="19">We also need to identify which names are ones that don’t fit God’s vision
          and identity for us—harmful names spoken in haste or hate or anger, names that we will be
          better off allowing God to erase. For most of us, discovering and changing those names
          will be a lifelong endeavor, but awareness is a crucial first step.</p>
