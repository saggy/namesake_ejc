        <p class="Body" i="36">No one needed God’s grace more than Peter. We’ve already seen Peter’s
          pattern of ups and downs throughout his walk with Jesus. Now let’s look at how Jesus
          responded—how He handled disappointment.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="37">The order that events are shared in a specific Gospel often has meaning.
          We’ve seen how quickly Peter’s high point in <span onclick="biblepop('Matt.16.17')" i="38">Matthew 16:17</span>-18 was followed by his low point in <span onclick="biblepop('Matt.16.23')" i="39">Matthew 16:23</span>. What would we expect to happen
          next? For Peter to be kicked out of the group? Demoted from the position of leader?</p>

        <p class="Body" i="41">
          <span class="char-style-override-21" i="42">What happened next according to <span onclick="biblepop('Matt.17.1')" i="43">Matthew 17:1-3</span>?</span>

        <div class="answer" id="a44" onclick="answer(this)" question="What happened next according to Matthew 17:1-3?" i="44"></div>

        <p class="Body" i="45">
          <span class="char-style-override-21" i="46">Who was present?</span>
        </p>

        <div class="answer" id="a47" onclick="answer(this)" question="Who was present?" i="47"></div>

        <p class="Body" i="48">It’s clear that Jesus didn’t give up on Peter; instead, He continued to
          invite him into His inner circle, even bringing Peter with Him in the select group of
          disciples who had the amazing privilege of witnessing what we have come to call the
          Transfiguration, a moment of Jesus’ heavenly glory on earth.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="49">Now let’s look more closely at Peter’s “double Simon” moment, when Jesus
          admonished him by using his old name not once, but twice.</p>
