            <em style="font-style: normal;"> Most biblical names were given with one of two purposes: to mark the circumstances

        <p class="Body" id="p43p3">No mother wants there to be animosity and fighting between her children,
          whether it’s a simple argument in the backseat or, as in this family’s case, a full-blown
          war. In addition to a difficult pregnancy, Rebekah had the stress of knowing that her boys
          would cause the family constant anguish through their hostility.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p43p4">After the twins were born, Rebekah and Isaac’s circumstances must have been
          both anxious and exhausting. So I want to be as understanding as possible toward this
          couple of inexperienced parents when it comes to naming their twin boys. But it seems odd
          to me in a family with such a rich history of naming stories that they didn’t put more
          thought into the process. In fact, they seem to have chosen the first names that popped
          into their heads when the boys were born. That’s the only explanation I can think of for
          the unusual names these twins ended up with.</p>

        <div class="answer" id="p43la2" onclick="answer(this)" question="Reread Genesis 25:25-26. Write the names they gave their sons and the meaning of each name."></div>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p43p7">Their firstborn was covered from head to toe in red
          hair, so they named him Hairy, which in Hebrew was Esau. Original, right? When they got
          really creative with a nickname, they called the kid Edom, or Red. No baby-naming books
          needed here. They just went with their first impression.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p43p8">As Esau was born they noticed that a little hand was tightly gripping his
          heel, as if to say, “Oh no you don’t! I want to be first!” The new parents took one look
          at that little hand and named their baby Grabby, which to us is the name Jacob.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p43p9">Perhaps more than in any other story in the Bible, Jacob’s character was
          shaped from the beginning by his name. It not only reflected the circumstances of his
          birth, since he was grabbing at his brother’s heel, but in some contexts Jacob also means
          “Deceiver,” “Taker of What Is Not His.” This unfortunate connotation had a deep impact on
          the person Jacob would become.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p43p10">Most biblical names were given with one of two
          purposes: to mark the circumstances surrounding a person’s birth or to describe specific
          character traits or gifts the child would grow to have. Jacob’s name was both. His name
          started out as one that told the story of his birth—grabbing his brother’s heel—and ended
          up describing the character trait for which he was best known—grabbing what was not his.
          The double meaning of his name had unintentional consequences as Jacob grew into his name
          and its character. Sometimes our names do come to have double meanings.</p>
