          <li class="PoetryText1"><sup>1</sup>
 In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from 
Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in 
the country of Moab. <sup>2</sup>
 The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife’s name Naomi, and the 
names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, 
Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.</li>
			<li class="PoetryText1"><sup>3</sup>
 Now Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. <sup>4</sup>
 They 
married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived 
there about ten years, <sup>5</sup>
 both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without 
her two sons and her husband.</li>
			<li class="PoetryText1"><sup>6</sup>
 When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. 
<sup>7</sup>
 With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out 
on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.</li>
			<li class="PoetryText1"><sup>8</sup>
 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your 
mother’s home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead 
and to me. <sup>9</sup>
 May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another 
husband.”</li>
			<li class="PoetryText1">Then she kissed them and they wept aloud <sup>10</sup> and said to her, “We will go back with 
you to your people.”</li>
			<li class="PoetryText1"><sup>11</sup> But Naomi said, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? 
Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? <sup>12</sup> Return home, 
my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still 
hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons— <sup>13</sup> would 
you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my 
daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD’s hand has gone out 
against me!”</li>
			<li class="PoetryText1"><sup>14</sup> At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth 
clung to her</li>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Grief takes your breath away. My breathless moment is frozen in a memory in 
front of a Christmas tree at my grandmother’s house. We were finishing up the 
last touches on decorations, presents, and dinner while waiting for my aunt and </p>
