    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">on a verdict. She wanted to know: <span class="char-style-override-17">What does He have to say to me?</span> This teacher had told those gathered to look into their own hearts to see if they were sinless. Clearly, she was not. So what would He have to say to her?</p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="woj char-style-override-21">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('John.8.10')">John 8:10</span>-11. What did Jesus tell her in verse 11?</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body">In that moment, Jesus offered her release and responsibility. His statements strike such a delicate balance. First He forgave her; then He set her on a new course in life. He gave her freedom from the past and a new path for the future, all in just two short phrases.</p>

      <p class="Body">“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.1.1')">John 1:1</span>). The Gospel of John introduces Jesus with a preamble that is pure poetry. It weaves a picture of Jesus that touches both heart and mind before launching into the stories of His life and ministry. One sentence especially captures the tension of the two phrases this story holds in balance.</p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('John.1.14')">John 1:14</span> and fill in the blanks:</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-23">“We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of __________ and __________.”</span> <span class="char-style-override-21">(NIV)</span></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body"></p>

      <p class="Body">No two words better sum up Jesus’ ministry. His entire life was a balance of offering people grace and telling people the truth. Grace without truth means that we’ll fall for anything, even while being compassionate. The truth without grace makes us hard and unforgiving, even when we’re right.</p>

      <p class="Body">If Jesus had left her with that first statement, “Neither do I condemn you,” she would’ve walked away free, but she probably would have walked right back into her life of sin. Yet He didn’t stop there. Instead, He gave her a gentle command: “Go and sin no more” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.8.11')">John 8:11</span> NKJV). That phrase isn’t quoted nearly as often as the verse we looked at yesterday: “He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.8.7')">John 8:7</span> WEB). It’s a lot less popular—harder to say and harder to swallow. It says, <span class="char-style-override-17">When you look inside and recognize your own sin, you need to do something about it.</span></p>

      <p class="Body">Jesus could have comforted her with a “There, there” and sent her on her way. He could have said, “Go, and be yourself; you’re OK just the way you are”; “Go, and continue your relationship—you can’t help who you love. All love is OK in my eyes”; “Go and enjoy yourself, you deserve to have a little fun.” Instead, He said: “Go and sin no more” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.8.11')">John 8:11</span> NKJV).</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">“Sin no more” means God wants a better life for us than the one we’ve been leading. It means we have the responsibility to deal with our own impulses,</p>
