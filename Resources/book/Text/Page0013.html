      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p13p1">Those living in the time when the Bible was written definitely invested a lot of effort and thought when they named their children. Names were given to tell a story. A name could carry in it the story of the circumstances surrounding a birth or the weight of the hopes and dreams a child’s parents had for him or her. Introductions by name revealed the character or blessings parents hoped children would embody as they grew. Robert L. Hubbard Jr. puts it this way: “In Israel, names were not just labels of individuality but descriptions of inner character . . . presumed to influence the person’s conduct.”<sup>1</sup></p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p13p14">Abraham and Sarah themselves—named Abram and Sarai at birth—were certainly born to parents trying to tell a story with their children’s names.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p13p15">Baby Abram was given a name that seems odd to us now. Not many of us would look at a tiny newborn, all squinty-eyed with tiny fingernails, and pronounce him “Exalted Father,” which is what Abram’s name means in Hebrew. To us, it seems strange to gaze at a newborn and call him “Father,” but to his parents it represented all of their greatest dreams for him. Abram’s parents wanted his name to tell<img src="../../images/rarr.png"></p>
