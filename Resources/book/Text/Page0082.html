    <p class="Body" id="p82p10" i="42">I drove my little, two-door Ford across the country, packed with all my most treasured possessions. I was leaving my home state and enrolling in four years of seminary far from everyone I knew. I felt grownup, adventurous, and more than a little lonely.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p82p11" i="43">With all of my closest friends hours away, I worried that I would be lost in a sea of new people. Who would appreciate my quirky sense of humor? Who would comfort me when I was homesick? As usual, I shouldn’t have worried so much.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p82p12" i="44">It was in the middle of my first week in my new surroundings that I met Tina. During orientation exercises new students participated in activities to help us meet new friends and feel a little less lost. During one activity, when someone shouted out a question, we were supposed to gather in circles with others who had things in common with us. Who had birthdays in the same month? I was in a circle full of Aprils. Who had the same color eyes? I was staring into a circle of greens. But then came the question: How many people were in the family you grew up in? There I was, alone in the middle of the other circles, holding up two fingers. I had grown up an only child raised by a single mom. Were there no other “twos” out there to join me? Suddenly, from somewhere in the crowd, came Tina, holding up two fingers to match mine, grinning as if she was just as relieved as me to find someone to circle up with. We became our own little circle of two.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p82p13" i="45">Tina was also an only child, raised by a wonderful single mom like mine. We quickly figured out that we had a lot more in common. We became best friends and soon were roommates, too.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p82p14" i="46">The years that we were roommates were some of the most joyful and most difficult of my life. During those years God was doing spiritual heart surgery on me, revealing and correcting some of my deepest flaws and unhealthy patterns in<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="47"></p>
