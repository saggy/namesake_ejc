      <p class="Body">Peter’s first outburst meant that he recognized Jesus as the Messiah when others (even those close to Jesus) had no clue. Peter’s second, disruptive outburst had him standing squarely in Jesus’ path, blocking the way to God’s mission on earth. Although God’s people had been waiting and hoping for a Messiah for thousands of years, their understanding of what the Messiah would do never included suffering or death by crucifixion, something reserved for the most scandalous criminals.</p>
