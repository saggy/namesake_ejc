        <p class="Body" i="13">Ruth’s heart of service toward Naomi inspired Boaz to help her. And in turn,
          watching Ruth’s tireless hard work and kindness and learning of Boaz’s acts of compassion
          helped wake Naomi from her fog of grief. After her bitterness and depression had kept her
          frozen and immobile for so long, something in Naomi began to melt. Her sense of hope began
          to return. She saw Ruth’s plan of action to keep them alive and she began to come up with
          a plan of her own. And that’s when things really started to turn around for Ruth and
          Naomi.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="14">Naomi knew that she and Ruth couldn’t live on leftover wheat forever, and so
          she put into action a plan so controversial it had to be done under the cover of darkness.
          She planned to get Boaz to marry Ruth and restore their family to financial health and
          standing in the community (a plan we will explore in detail tomorrow as we study chapter
          3). And her plan worked!</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24" i="15"></p>

        <p class="Body" i="16">• Ruth acted with selflessness, serving Naomi.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="17">• Boaz acted with integrity, serving and protecting Ruth.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="18">• <span i="19">Naomi came up with a plan that had daring audacity, one that would
            serve to reward Ruth for her kindness and ensure a future with hope for all of
            them.</span></p>

        <div class="answer" id="p91la3" onclick="answer(this)" question="Think of a way you have seen people help others by acting with submission and selflessness (like Ruth’s actions):" i="32"></div>

        <p class="Body" i="33">Peeking ahead to the happy ending of the story, we find that when Boaz and
          Ruth marry and have their first child, they name him Obed. Obed’s name means “Servant.”
          This may seem an unusual name for the son of the boss, the landowner who had servants
          working for him. Why name their child “Servant”? The clue to that mystery can be found by
          examining the heart of Obed’s parents and grandmother. They had servants’ hearts, thinking
          of others before themselves, not unlike the One who would come much later in their family
          tree.</p>
