When we do, moments when we impatiently thought nothing was happening at all can become some of the most productive, transformational times of our lives.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p33p6" i="18"><span onclick="biblepop('Ps.46.10')" i="19">Psalm 46:10</span> tells us to “be still, and know that I am God.” Spend some time waiting on God in prayer. This isn’t time to ask God for anything or even to talk to Him; it’s just a time to wait and be quiet. Set aside a time and place where you can be silent. Set a timer for five or ten minutes if it helps. Sit still and quiet the thoughts of your mind. If a thought comes to your mind, let it float away like a leaf floats downstream, and return your mind to quiet.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p33p7" i="20">This is sometimes difficult the first time or the first few times you try it. Our minds naturally have a lot of thoughts rumbling around, and they pop up quickly when we’re quiet. The discipline of quieting your mind and sitting still is one that will carry over to other moments in your days. The peace you receive in this waiting time will seep out into the other areas of your life.</p>

Many people use their “waiting” time in line, in a doctor’s office, and even in traffic to make calls or text messages or check their e-mail and Facebook on their phones. This week, take a day where you intentionally wait in “electronic silence.” Look around the doctor’s office and observe those around you. Start a conversation with those in line at the grocery store. Observe the people and things around you and ask God to teach you something. What can you learn from your waiting time this week?</p>

Where is your attention as you wait for little things? What is your attitude? How about the big things in your life? Look back and remember waiting for life events and how it felt to wait. Write a paragraph praising God for who He is and what He provides while you wait on Him. Look ahead to things you are waiting for now and write about how God is working in your life as you wait.</p></li></ul></div>
