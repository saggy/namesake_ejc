    <p class="Body">I’ll be happy when . . .</p>

    <p class="Body">I must have finished this sentence a hundred times in my life. I’ll be happy when I get my degree. When I have a job. When I find my soul mate. When he proposes. When we can afford a bigger house. When we finally have the children we long for.</p>

    <p class="Body">This last one was a biggie for me. Our years of struggle with infertility and miscarriage were a constant rollercoaster of hope and disappointment. Grief is usually an emotion we feel for someone who is no longer with us. But my husband and I struggled with grief for someone who had not yet arrived. Grief for the children we longed for. Grief for the ones we lost. Grief for our dreams. The pain of those moments made me wish for another life, another reality. It made me think happiness was something always just over the horizon, never within reach.</p>

    <p class="Body">There were bright spots, such as relationships that deepened because I needed someone to lean on. I realized that there were a handful of friends I could call on at any time. My husband and I turned to each other for comfort and found we had a depth in our marriage we didn’t know existed. I would love to tell you that I turned to God consistently, like I thought a good Christian should, and that I found spiritual comfort there from my pain. The truth is that sometimes I didn’t feel like talking to God at all. Sometimes I felt like He wasn’t in the room when I cried out to Him, or I felt angry that He wasn’t answering my prayers. When I looked around and saw friends with their children, I wondered why He loved others enough to give them their hearts’ desire when mine went unfulfilled.</p>
