I will. I will.</span> God doesn’t take these promises lightly, and neither should we. Abraham and Sarah discovered that God could and would always keep His promises. I’m so thankful that I turned my nine-year-old heart over to Him. No matter my actions or behavior, He has been faithful in loving me ever since. And He always will. He will do the same for you.</p>
