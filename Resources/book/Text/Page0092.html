        <p class="Body" i="26">Rachel did come with us on the Habitat for Humanity build that Saturday. The
          offer of a Saturday of free babysitting was more than a single mom could resist! She had
          never worked with construction tools before, but she was able to hammer in a few nails in
          sheetrock, help prepare lunch, and bring water to other workers on a very hot Texas day.
          Best of all she met Rosario, the single mom for whom we were helping build the house.
          Rosario had a sad story of her own, but there she was working alongside us, excited to
          help finish the first house she and her four kids would get to call home. Hearing
          Rosario’s story and watching her work so hard alongside those who had come to help her
          really had an effect on Rachel. Her own story seemed less overwhelming as she focused on
          someone else’s needs for a few hours. When she returned home that day, nothing in her
          circumstances had changed, but something in her outlook was definitely shifting in a new
          direction.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="31">We worship a God who serves. He came to earth not as a magnificent king but
          as a lowly rabbi. When the opportunity presented itself for Him to sit back and be catered
          to at His last dinner on earth, He instead took the role of servant, washing the feet of
          those who followed Him. That role of serving those He loves is one He is still acting on
          today.</p>
