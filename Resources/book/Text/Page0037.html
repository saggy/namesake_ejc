    <div style="height: 100%; margin-right: 200px;"><p class="Body">Building an altar implies both worship and sacrifice. Calling on the name of God means they are beginning to understand that the characteristics at the heart of God are central to the future they are now seeking.</p>

    <p class="Body">Even more than with other names in Scripture, the use of “name” in reference to God is so much more than a proper noun that can be spelled on paper or spoken aloud. It is a representation of the One who bears that name: of His character, His promises, His strength. When Abram and Sarai call on the name of the Lord, it is about so much more than getting God’s attention. They are worshipping and praising God for who He is and also looking forward to His future help in their lives. At the beginning of chapter 12, God approached them. Now they are coming to God, throwing themselves on the mercy of His promises and His strength.</p>

    <p class="Body">When we call on God’s name, we aren’t saying, “God, do things my way”; we’re saying, “God, in agreement with who You are, with all Your power, Your love, and mercy, I call on Your name—Your character—to act in this situation.”&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="Body">Prayer that calls on God’s name is not about hoping that He will come around to see things the way we do or that He will acquiesce to our will and do things our way. When we call on God’s name, we are asking God to change our hearts, our character, to be more like His. Not the other way around.</p>

    <p class="Body">Like Abraham and Sarah and the people of Babel, we’re builders, too. We’re constructing something with each action, decision, and interaction. We get to choose over and over whether to stay stuck in the bankruptcy of chapter 11 or to move with Abraham and Sarah into worshipping a God so great, so beyond our own fragile human existence, that we instinctively know how much we need Him. Do we want to build a tower to ourselves or an altar to God? Whose name will we call on for strength and help?</p></div>
