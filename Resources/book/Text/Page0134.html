Come here!”</span></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-dan-3-26 char-style-override-17">So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,</span> <span class="text-dan-3-27 char-style-override-18">27</span><span class="text-dan-3-27 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.</span></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-dan-3-28 char-style-override-18">28</span><span class="text-dan-3-28 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king’s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.</span> <span class="text-dan-3-29 char-style-override-18">29</span><span class="text-dan-3-29 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.”</span></p>
