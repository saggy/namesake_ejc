    <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p88p10" i="35">Rachel sat across a table from me at a coffee shop, crying. Her life was in shambles. Her promising future had taken a detour halfway through college when she got pregnant and moved back home to have a baby. The baby’s father wanted no part of supporting them or being part of their lives. A couple of years later she met what she thought was the man of her dreams. After a whirlwind courtship, they married and became an instant family with lots of hope for the future. Now, only a few months later, they were separated and headed for divorce. She was back to living with her parents and relying on their help while she searched in vain for a job that could support her and her daughter, but daycare costs were greater than any salary she qualified for.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p88p11" i="36">“I just don’t know what to do anymore!” Rachel told me. “I sit at home and wonder about my future. I can’t seem to figure it out, and my thoughts just go in circles!”</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p88p12" i="37">After listening to her talk for almost an hour, I made a simple suggestion: “Why not come with us on Saturday to the Habitat for Humanity build? There’s nursery care at the church for your little girl, and I think you might enjoy getting out with other people.” She looked at me like I was crazy. She was expecting me to help solve her problems. Why was I suggesting she help fix someone else’s?</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p88p13" i="38">Naomi and Ruth’s story holds some insight into Rachel’s situation. In the very first chapter of Naomi’s story (Ruth 1), we learned how she dealt with her grief and loss by becoming bitter and lashing out at God. Scripture doesn’t judge her reaction to tragedy, and neither do we. After all, anger and depression are very understandable and normal stages of grief. But in time they need to become just that, <span class="char-style-override-17" i="39">stages</span> that we move through on our way to other parts of our journey rather than places where we stay stuck. But how do we find a way to move on?</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p88p14" i="40">Ruth experienced the same kinds of loss that we see in Naomi’s story. She also was grieving the loss of her husband, as well as her father-in-law and brother-in-<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="41"></p>
