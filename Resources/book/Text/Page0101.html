    	  <p class="Body para-style-override-20">I know it’s not Walt Disney’s fault, but I spent a great deal of time and energy looking for that prince, the one who would make my life complete. It turned out that every man I met fell short of that expectation (not to mention bringing with them some problems of their own!), and I was left lonely and confused to begin the search again. It would be hard for me to overemphasize how much that obsession threw me off balance, causing me to over-focus on having a man in my life, charming or not. Because of it I neglected friendships and family relationships, missed lots of opportunities to rely on Jesus, and underestimated my ability to solve my own problems and progress unassisted toward my own happily-ever-after.&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="Body">I’m not alone. Telling a friend about the new man in her life, one woman said, “We met after my divorce, and he was my savior.” Really? I’m sure he’s great, but put anyone but Jesus on that particular pedestal and he’s sure to fall right off.</p>

    <p class="Body">I want to offer Kate a story big enough to build real dreams on. I want her to dream about a story that will capture her imagination and her longings, but I also want those longings to be ones that will actually be fulfilled. I want her to know that yes, she does need a Savior, and that He is the One who can provide the kind of rescue we <span class="char-style-override-17">all</span> need.</p>

    <p class="Body">I don’t mind if Kate wants to dress up as Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, but I don’t want her to learn those stories by heart until I have a chance to tell her another story. A true story. The story of Ruth.</p>

    <p class="Body">Here’s what I love about Ruth, the anti-princess:</p>

    <p class="Body"></p>

    <p class="Body">• She’s from the despised land of Moab (and not the chosen people of Israel), but that doesn’t stop her from becoming our heroine. Just the fact that she gets the starring role means that God doesn’t play favorites.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">• The central relationship of her story is not a romance but a friendship <span>between women. Our daughters need to know that friendships will be some of the strongest and most meaningful blessings in their lives, and that they should hold tightly to them, even when they think Prince Charming beckons.</span></p>

    <p class="Body">• When tragedy strikes and Ruth and Naomi are left without a man to provide for them, Ruth doesn’t bemoan the fact that she has no rights, or that</p>
