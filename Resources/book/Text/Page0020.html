    <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p20p2" i="14">Nicodemus’s story is told in <span onclick="biblepop('John.3.1')" i="15">John 3:1-21</span>. Nicodemus was a Pharisee, a religious leader in his day, known for living life on the “up and up.” No sneaking around for him! But because the Pharisees were a group of Jesus’ most ardent critics and enemies, Nicodemus snuck in to talk to Jesus at night. He wanted to hide his interest in Jesus and his teaching, an interest that would have been looked on unfavorably by the other Pharisees and their followers.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p20p7" i="28">Nicodemus’s faith developed in a way that many Christians can identify with. First, he was curious about Jesus but hesitant to do anything about it. He probably watched believers around him carefully, wondering what made their lives so different from the rule-bound Pharisees he spent his time with. When he could no longer contain his curiosity, he began to talk privately to Jesus. His faith was hidden from the light of day for a while so that no one could question or make fun of him. Then he finally went public with his convictions. The crucifixion of Jesus meant that Nicodemus couldn’t contain or hide his faith any longer. He wanted to do something about it.</p>

    <p class="Body" id="p20p8" i="29">Going public with our faith involves a great deal more than attending church or wearing a Christian T-shirt. It means showing the characteristics of Christ in our lives that match the change going on in our hearts. Public faith affects the way we treat others, the way we handle anger or disappointment, and the way we choose to sacrifice for the good of others.</p>
