    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp" i="13">and how dangerous it might be for God’s people to try to move into. One man is chosen from each of the twelve tribes. In <span onclick="biblepop('Num.13.8')" i="14">Numbers 13:8</span> we learn the identity of the spy from the tribe of Ephraim: “Hoshea son of Nun.”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="15">Only just a few verses later, Hoshea’s name is changed, an act that by now should be familiar to us! Just a few verses after he is first mentioned, he is Hoshea no more.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="16"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="17"><span class="char-style-override-21" i="18">Read <span onclick="biblepop('Num.13.16')" i="19">Numbers 13:16</span>. What new name is Hoshea given?</span></p>

       	  <div class="answer" id="a20" onclick="answer(this)" question="Read Numbers 13:16. What new name is Hoshea given?" i="20"></div>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="21">This time it’s not God who renames someone but a leader, a mentor in faith. Hoshea’s name originally meant “Salvation,” but Joshua, tweaked by the addition of a new first letter, means “The Lord Is Salvation” or “God Saves.” That new letter, <span class="char-style-override-17" i="22">yod</span>, was meant to point to the name of God revealed to Moses at the burning bush: Jehovah—the name we translate “I <span class="char-style-override-14" i="23">am</span>.” By adding that letter it made Hoshea’s name—“The Desire for Salvation or Rescue”—a reality. By speaking Joshua’s new name, Moses was actually naming aloud the One responsible for His people’s rescue: Jehovah. Once, God’s people had been so afraid to pronounce that name that they deliberately inserted the wrong consonants for fear that someone would try to say the name of God aloud and by doing so commit blasphemy and incur judgment. Now they were trying to call on that name when they knew they needed saving help, salvation, the most.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="24">As those spies went on their dangerous mission, this one man, Joshua, would prove to be different than the majority of his peers. It’s possible that his new name gave him the confidence and insight to see God’s hand in every situation, even as dangerous as they found that new land to be. He and one other man, Caleb, would not be afraid of the overwhelming power they found there but would declare that God could give His people victory—that God was powerful enough to save in any situation, just as Joshua’s new name announced.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="25">Joshua was right about God’s ability to save His people and bring them victoriously into the Promised Land. He became a great leader of God’s people, one who went down in history as trusting that “God Saves,” just as his name proclaimed.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="26">When Mary and Joseph were called on to name their baby boy, the name they spoke over Him, the name an angel commanded each of them to give Him, was Joshua. God Saves. The Hebrew name Joshua in our Greek translations of the New Testament becomes <span class="char-style-override-17" i="27">I¯esous</span>, or Jesus. Jesus’ first name was Joshua.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="28">In the moment that He received the name Jesus, God the Son became the namesake of God the Father. His name was an echo of the “I <span class="char-style-override-14" i="29">am</span>” (Jehovah) given at the burning bush, that first invitation for God’s people to know God’s name.</p>
