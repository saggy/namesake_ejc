        <p class="Body">If we cling to anything but God, even if we cling to our own
          self-sufficiency or our own false identities, we will find ourselves sinking into a pit
          we’ve dug for ourselves. But if we let go and grab hold of God, we’ll discover that we’re
          closer to finding the peace, forgiveness, and transformation we long for. Those who
          pretend otherwise are still clinging to a lie.</p>

        <p class="Body">The fact that God loves us and chooses us is no guarantee that we won’t
          struggle. But it is a guarantee that we won’t struggle alone.</p>

        <p class="Body">Instead of leaving Jacob alone in his time of struggle, God wrestled with
          Him through one of the most difficult times in his life. He also renamed him Israel,
          indicating that God would continue to wrestle with him—and with the people who would
          follow in his family—when times were tough.</p>

            there been a time when you knew without a doubt that God was with you? If so, describe

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24">When we wrestle with the issues of life—even issues
          we’ve brought on ourselves, like Jacob—God will be right there wrestling with us, bringing
          us an outcome of blessing, even when we don’t deserve it. God will always be there to
          offer a new blessing, a new name, and a new chance to be declared His children.</p>

          prayer asking God to help you cling only to Him and nothing else for security.</p>
