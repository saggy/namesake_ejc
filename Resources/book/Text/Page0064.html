        <p class="Body" id="p64p3" i="21">If we cling to anything but God, even if we cling to our own
          self-sufficiency or our own false identities, we will find ourselves sinking into a pit
          we’ve dug for ourselves. But if we let go and grab hold of God, we’ll discover that we’re
          closer to finding the peace, forgiveness, and transformation we long for. Those who
          pretend otherwise are still clinging to a lie.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p64p5" i="23">Instead of leaving Jacob alone in his time of struggle, God wrestled with
          Him through one of the most difficult times in his life. He also renamed him Israel,
          indicating that God would continue to wrestle with him—and with the people who would
          follow in his family—when times were tough.</p>
