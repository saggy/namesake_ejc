        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">lost interest in the sermons by circling
          the typos in the church bulletin. Although our secretary was unique to say the least, it
          turns out we weren’t the only church that was titillated by typos.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Besides providing hymn numbers and liturgy, church
          bulletins often provide entertainment for those in the pews. Here are a couple that have
          actually appeared in church bulletins:</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

        <p class="Body">This evening at 7 <span class="char-style-override-14">pm</span> there will
          be a hymn sing in the park across from the<br /> church. Bring a blanket and come prepared
          to sin.</p>

        <p class="Body">Remember in prayer the many that are sick of our community.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20">One little letter can change singers to sinners. One
          misplaced word makes people sick in the church sick <span class="char-style-override-17"
            >of</span> the church. Who says you can’t laugh in church? There’s one particular church
          bulletin typo that is my favorite, although not because it makes people giggle. I like to
          look for it because I believe it’s by far the most common. By my estimates, this word is
          probably misspelled half the time in church bulletins. See if you can detect it.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

        <p class="Body">During Communion, those who feel led may come forward for prayer at the
          alter.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

        <p class="Body">Did you catch it? We see the word <span class="char-style-override-17"
            >alter</span> so often that it seems appropriate to substitute it for <span
            class="char-style-override-17">altar</span>, usually the word we mean to use in church.
          Only one letter is different, yet this one letter completely changes the meaning.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

        <p class="Body">Alter: To make different, to change or modify, to cause a transformation</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

        <p class="Body">Altar: A structure, typically a table, at which religious rites are
          performed. The central structure in Christian worship and Holy Communion.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

        <p class="Body">The reason this one little misspelling appeals to me is that I think <span
            class="char-style-override-17">alter</span> is an appropriate word for what happens to
          us during worship. Worship changes us. It alters us. When we gather around an altar as a
          community of believers, something in our hearts is transformed, modified, made different.
          Worship can transform our situation and surroundings until we find ourselves no longer in
          a dark sanctuary but at the throne of God. Worship shifts our focus outside ourselves and
          reminds us that there is a greater reality beyond the struggles we face.</p>
