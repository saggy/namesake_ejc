        <p class="Body" i="16">A similar change occurred in another king of Babylon some years later. On
          Day 3 we read about Daniel defying King Darius’s decree that no one could pray to any god
          or man except him, and we saw that he was sentenced to be thrown into a den of lions.
          Today we pick up the story where we left off.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="31">When Daniel survived a night in the lions’ den, King Darius changed his tune
          completely. Instead of demanding that all people pray only to the king, he issued another
          decree.</p>
