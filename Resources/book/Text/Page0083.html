    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">relationships, but He also was confirming again and again that He loved me and was calling me to serve Him in ministry. Through the good and the bad moments of those years, Tina was there for me. She had an uncanny way of knowing when I had a bad day and recognizing when I needed a serious listening ear or a goofy joke to cheer me up.</p>

    <p class="Body">In the years since we lived together, Tina and I have logged lots of hours of phone conversations. We developed an ability to recognize each other’s voices on the phone instantly. Instead of an introduction, the one calling would just start the conversation by saying simply, “It’s me,” and then launching right into conversation.</p>

    <p class="Body">“It’s me” has also come to mean “you can tell me anything,” “you can be yourself with me,” and “I will love you and be your friend no matter what you’re going through.”</p>

    <p class="Body">If one of us begins to doubt that we can share our fears or failures, if we hesitate to disclose something painful or revealing, the other just responds, “Hey. It’s me.” Feeling comforted by those words, the other one will inevitably continue.</p>

    <p class="Body">That kind of friendship, the kind that sustains us in the highest and lowest points of life, is a gift from God. God sends people into our lives as His agents, His instruments, to show us what unconditional love feels like. We can’t expect our friends to be perfect, but we can expect to find signs of how God loves us in the love of other people.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Although the central figure of our story this week is Naomi, the book of the Bible that contains her story is named for her daughter-in-law Ruth. In Ruth 1, Naomi gains a gift like no other in the friendship of Ruth. Ruth’s name, in fact, means “Friend.” These women have been through both joy and grief together, and when Naomi decides to return to her homeland, she urges both of her daughters-in-law to return to their own families. One of them, Orpah, decides to return to her parents, but Ruth refuses to go back.</p>

    <p class="Body">Her powerful and beautiful words have become classic poetry:</p>

May the L</span><span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span> <span class="char-style-override-17">deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.” When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.</span></p>
