        <p class="Body" id="p90p1" i="13">If we are feeling stressed and overwhelmed by the circumstances of our own
          lives, it sometimes helps to look outside ourselves to the needs of others. That seems
          counterintuitive. If our resources are scarce and our lives frazzled, shouldn’t we stay
          focused on solving our own problems? Isn’t it true that “God helps those who help
          themselves”? Actually, that phrase is nowhere to be found in the Bible. Instead, Scripture
          offers us a different prescription.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p90p4" i="19">This is a remedy best applied to our own wounds, not to others. When someone
          is struggling or in pain, a listening ear is almost always the best help we can offer. But
          if we apply this medicine to our own hurts, it often turns out that our example of caring
          for the needs of others, even when our needs are great, can inspire those who are watching
          to do the same. That was certainly true in Ruth’s case. Her goodness and hard work were
          noticed and rewarded.</p>

          <span i="21">First, Boaz, the owner of the fields in which Ruth worked each day, noticed her
            determination. He perceived that Ruth was a remarkable young woman. He saw that she
            wasn’t wallowing in self-pity or waiting for someone to take care of her problems for
            her. And her take-charge attitude inspired Boaz to help her succeed.</span>
