        <p class="Body" id="p32p2">In the Old Testament there are several words that can be translated to the
          English word <span class="char-style-override-17">wait</span>. The most commonly used
          Hebrew word translated “wait” is <span class="char-style-override-17">qavah.</span> It
          means “to bind together” (by twisting strands, as in making a rope) or to “look
          patiently,” “tarry or wait,” “hope, expect, look eagerly.”</p>

        <div class="answer" id="p32la1" onclick="answer(this)" question="What is your favorite Hebrew word for &quot;wait&quot;?"></div>

        <p class="Body" id="p32p5">I think this word is my favorite of all the Hebrew words that mean “wait,”
          because of the image of binding things together. God used my time of waiting to bind my
          marriage and other relationships closer together and to bind my heart closer to His than
          it had ever been. I never would have chosen the path that we went down over those years.
          The pain of waiting and loss brings a twinge of tenderness in my heart even years later.
          But I recognize now that my practice being a “patient” actually strengthened my “patience”
          more than I could have imagined at the time. Those years gave me a deep appreciation for
          Abraham and Sarah. When I read their story of waiting, I see between the lines their years
          of discouragement and anguish but also their growth in trust and hope in God. I know all
          too well the longing they experienced for the gift they wanted to hold in their arms. But
          I also know they received countless gifts while holding their empty arms out to God.</p>

        <p id="p32p9">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="Body" id="p32p10">Waiting means to trust that God is good, even when we can’t see it in the
          ways we wanted or expected. Waiting means seeking God’s help and comfort in prayer and
          worship when we can’t find it in our material world. Waiting means asking God to change us
          instead of expecting to change God. Abraham and Sarah had different hearts, a different
          marriage, and a different outlook on God’s promises after twenty-five years of
          waiting.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p32p13">Trusting in God doesn’t mean that our prayers will be
          instantaneously answered, as if God were some cosmic vending machine ready to dispense our
          wishes and wants. Instead, it means that our waiting and longing can become a tool that
          transforms us rather than an obstacle to happiness and fulfillment.<img src="../../images/rarr.png"></p>
