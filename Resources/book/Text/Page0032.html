    	<div style="height: 100%; margin-left: 200px;"><p class="Body">In the Old Testament there are several words that can be translated to the English word <span class="char-style-override-17">wait</span>. The most commonly used Hebrew word translated “wait” is <span class="char-style-override-17">qavah.</span> It means “to bind together” (by twisting strands, as in making a rope) or to “look patiently,” “tarry or wait,” “hope, expect, look eagerly.”</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Look up the following Scriptures about waiting: <span onclick="biblepop('Ps.27.14')">Psalm 27:14</span>, <span onclick="biblepop('Ps.130.5')">Psalm 130:5</span>-7, and <span onclick="biblepop('Isa.40.31')">Isaiah 40:31</span>. All three use the word</span> <span class="char-style-override-23">q</span><span class="char-style-override-23">avah</span> <span class="char-style-override-21">for wait. Choose your favorite and write it below:</span></p>

    <p class="Body">I think this word is my favorite of all the Hebrew words that mean “wait,” because of the image of binding things together. God used my time of waiting to bind my marriage and other relationships closer together and to bind my heart closer to His than it had ever been. I never would have chosen the path that we went down over those years. The pain of waiting and loss brings a twinge of tenderness in my heart even years later. But I recognize now that my practice being a “patient” actually strengthened my “patience” more than I could have imagined at the time. Those years gave me a deep appreciation for Abraham and Sarah. When I read their story of waiting, I see between the lines their years of discouragement and anguish but also their growth in trust and hope in God. I know all too well the longing they experienced for the gift they wanted to hold in their arms. But I also know they received countless gifts while holding their empty arms out to God.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read the following verses: <span onclick="biblepop('Ps.40.1')">Psalm 40:1</span>, <span onclick="biblepop('Ps.119.114')">Psalm 119:114</span>, <span onclick="biblepop('Lam.3.25')">Lamentations 3:25</span>, <span onclick="biblepop('Isa.25.9')">Isaiah 25:9</span>. What&nbsp;can we learn about God&nbsp;as we trust Him in our waiting?</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">Waiting means to trust that God is good, even when we can’t see it in the ways we wanted or expected. Waiting means seeking God’s help and comfort in prayer and worship when we can’t find it in our material world. Waiting means asking God to change us instead of expecting to change God. Abraham and Sarah had different hearts, a different marriage, and a different outlook on God’s promises after twenty-five years of waiting.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">How has waiting changed you or your relationship with God?</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Trusting in God doesn’t mean that our prayers will be instantaneously answered, as if God were some cosmic vending machine ready to dispense our wishes and wants. Instead, it means that our waiting and longing can become a tool that transforms us rather than an obstacle to happiness and fulfillment. </p></div>
