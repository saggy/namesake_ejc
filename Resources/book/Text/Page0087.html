    <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p87p2" i="16"><span class="text-ruth-2-2 char-style-override-17" i="17">Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.”</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-3 char-style-override-18" i="18">3</span><span class="text-ruth-2-3 char-style-override-17" i="19">&nbsp;So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p87p3" i="20"><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-18" i="21">4</span><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-17" i="22">&nbsp;Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “The L</span><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-19" i="23">ord</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-17" i="24">be with you!”</span></p>

Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-9 char-style-override-18" i="40">9</span><span class="text-ruth-2-9 char-style-override-17" i="41">&nbsp;Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p87p10" i="58"><span class="text-ruth-2-13 char-style-override-18" i="59">13</span><span class="text-ruth-2-13 char-style-override-17" i="60">&nbsp;“May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,” she said. “You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p87p11" i="61"><span class="text-ruth-2-14 char-style-override-18" i="62">14</span><span class="text-ruth-2-14 char-style-override-17" i="63">&nbsp;At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here.

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p87p12" i="64"><span class="text-ruth-2-14 char-style-override-17" i="65">When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain.

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p87p13" i="70"><span class="text-ruth-2-17 char-style-override-18" i="71">17</span><span class="text-ruth-2-17 char-style-override-17" i="72">&nbsp;So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening.

Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24" id="p87p14" i="75"><span class="text-ruth-2-19 char-style-override-18" i="76">19</span><span class="text-ruth-2-19 char-style-override-17" i="77">&nbsp;Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today?

    <p class="Body para-style-override-38" id="p87p15" i="78"><span class="text-ruth-2-19 char-style-override-17" i="79">Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said.</span></p>
