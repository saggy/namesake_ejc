      <p style="text-align: justify;">Those living in the time when the Bible was written definitely invested a lot of effort and thought when they named their children. Names were given to tell a story. A name could carry in it the story of the circumstances surrounding a birth or the weight of the hopes and dreams a child’s parents had for him or her. Introductions by name revealed the character or blessings parents hoped children would embody as they grew. Robert L. Hubbard Jr. puts it this way: “In Israel, names were not just labels of individuality but descriptions of inner character . . . presumed to influence the person’s conduct.”<sup>1</sup></p>
