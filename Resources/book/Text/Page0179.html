      <p class="Body" i="25">The story we’ll be studying together this week is one of those anonymous stories in Scripture where we become close to a person without ever learning her name. The woman we meet in our story this week is one whose nickname—often written in Scripture in bold as a title above the first paragraph of her story—is a devastating label. Because of a mistake, a moment in her life she must not have been particularly proud of, she received a nickname that marks her in every Bible that has ever been printed. She is known only as “The Woman Caught in Adultery.”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="26">I don’t know about you, but if you rewound the story of my life and picked out my worst moments, I wouldn’t want to be known by them for posterity. I would hate it even more if I were to be known for the rest of history by the names that I was called or that I internally called myself during my toughest times.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="27">This woman was dragged onstage in the opening act of her own story by a group of men who were, shall we say, a little too excited about someone else’s sin. They were probably keyed up and out of breath, calling out to Jesus in animated voices: “Jesus! Here’s a woman caught in the very moment of her sin! We know what the Law says should be done with a woman like this. Since you’re teaching on the Law, since you think you’re qualified to say what is right and wrong here, what do you say? Judge her case for us.”</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="28">It’s clear from the story that these men weren’t interested in justice. They weren’t even interested in the woman. What they are interested in is Jesus—specifically, catching Him in a trap, a theological catch-22.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="29">If He agreed with them and with the law of Moses, saying they should stone her, He would be seizing power away from the law of Rome, and the Romans would have His head. If He said she should go free without punishment, He would be defying the law of Moses and likely would lose the respect of the crowds who had been following Him.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="30">They had Him cornered right where they wanted Him. At the least, they could split the crowd’s opinion of Him, reducing the size of His following by half. And if they were successful, they might even set in motion events that would lead not to the woman’s execution, but to Jesus’ own death.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="31">If they truly had been interested in sin and law and justice, there likely would have been another person present and named in the story. Let me give you a hint. It takes two to tango! There is no being caught in the act of adultery by yourself;<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="32"></p>
