    <p class="Body">Even today, many Jews still refer to Jehovah simply as <span class="char-style-override-17">Hashem</span>, which means, “The Name.” Some Jewish references to God remove the vowel and spell the word G*D or G_D so that no one will accidentally pronounce it out loud.</p>

    <p class="Body">I sometimes wonder if we’ve lost our sense of awe at God’s holiness—His nature that is bigger, greater, better than anything else we know in this life. In order to help people understand the personal nature of God, we try so hard to communicate God’s accessibility, approachability, closeness, and friendly nature that we portray Him as our buddy, our copilot, our divine BFF.</p>

    <p class="Body">When I pray, I like to picture Jesus walking next to me or sitting across a table from me. His humanity makes me feel comfortable and at ease. But I forget sometimes to honor His divinity as well, His holiness. Imagine having such reverence and awe for the powerful holiness of God that you dare not even speak His name out loud. Those who sought to protect the name of YHWH from anyone who would misuse it had great respect for the holiness of God’s name.</p>
