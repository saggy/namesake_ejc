        <p class="Body" id="p78p7">With no one left to call her “Honey,” no one left to call her “Mom,” Naomi
          decides that “Bitter” is the name that best applies to her current identity. She lets the
          grief take over and name her with heartache.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p78p8">Naomi’s reaction isn’t that surprising, really. How can we blame her for
          holding God responsible for the avalanche of tragedies she endured? In Elisabeth
          Kübler-Ross’s famous work on the stages of grief, anger is a normal and common stage.<span class="char-style-override-20">1</span> When there’s no easy explanation or person to
          blame, God is often the target for our anger.</p>

          in your struggles or that no one else has ever felt the way you do, a search of the psalms
          reveals that every feeling a person could express has been documented there.</p>
