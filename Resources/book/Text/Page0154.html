      <p class="Body" i="28">Peter’s journey is characterized by ups and downs along the way. Sometimes he shows his rocklike faith by walking on water to meet Jesus. Sometimes he sinks like a stone. But as we follow his life, we’ll find that he does change and grow and ultimately live into the name Jesus has given him.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="29"><span i="30">Your journey likely has ups and downs as well. Sometimes you may look like a poster child for the changes faith can bring. Other times you may find yourself sinking back into your old habits. Up or down, know that God is with you, and that His love for you does not change with the whims of your behavior. He is writing a new story for your life, and that story has grace spelled out on every page.</span></p>
