        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="22">God calls us to live so differently from the people
          around us that they take notice. He calls us to live the way Jesus did. Daniel, Hananiah,
          Mishael, and Azariah had God’s name embedded in their own names. When we make a pledge to
          follow Jesus, He gives us the name “Christian” to wear—a title that has the very name of
          Christ embedded in it. If we allow Him to continually transform our hearts and actions, we
          will bring honor and praise not to ourselves but to Christ, for His name’s sake.</p>
