<p class="Body">It’s no accident that the number three appears over and over again in Peter’s story, helping to tie the pieces together. Even though his story is recorded in fragments by the authors of all four Gospels, each of them remembered to mention the number that became very significant in Peter’s story.</p>

      <p class="Body">After Jesus asked the <span class="char-style-override-17">three</span> leading disciples to stay awake and pray with Him, He returned <span class="char-style-override-17">three</span> times to find them sleeping. When Jesus was arrested and dragged away to be beaten and put on trial, Peter followed at a distance. Those events must have seemed so unbelievable, so horrible. In the middle of it all, <span class="char-style-override-17">three</span> different people recognized Peter as a follower of Jesus. At the very moment Jesus needed Peter’s support the most, strong Peter melted into the old Simon and denied that he even knew Jesus—not once, not twice, but <span class="char-style-override-17">three</span> times. His mind must have flashed back to the conversation when Jesus predicted that betrayal. The feelings of failure and shame must have been overwhelming to Peter. Not only had he let down his Savior: he had done it even after Jesus had predicted and warned him about it!</p>

      <p class="Body">Here is where Peter needed forgiveness the most. This was his moment of greatest need, and this is where Jesus really triumphed. It’s at our times of greatest need that Jesus can show us the greatest forgiveness, and forgiveness was what those few days were all about. Within hours of Peter’s denial, Jesus was hanging on a cross, taking on the sins of the world. Even more important to Peter must have been the realization that Jesus was taking on <span class="char-style-override-17">his</span> sins as well.</p>

      <p class="Body">Here is where the arithmetic of God just doesn’t add up to the rest of the world.</p>

      <p class="Body">Somehow, when God is balancing the equation of grace, one innocent figure on a cross can equal forgiveness for all of humanity.</p>

      <p class="Body">One of the ironies of God’s arithmetic on the cross is that Peter already had had one math lesson in forgiveness. He was the one who sometime before had asked Jesus to set limits on forgiveness.</p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read <span onclick="biblepop('Matt.18.21')">Matthew 18:21</span>-22. What number did Peter propose for the limit of how many times he should be required to forgive?</span></p>

       	  <div class="answer" id="p165la1" onclick="answer(this)" question="Read Matthew 18:21-22. What number did Peter propose for the limit of how many times he should be required to forgive?"></div>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">What number did Jesus give him instead?</span></p>

       	  <div class="answer" id="p165la2" onclick="answer(this)" question="What number did Jesus give him instead?"></div>

      <p class="Body">In some translations Jesus’ number is given as “seventy seven times.” In others it’s translated “seventy times seven.” Think about it. To keep count of someone’s sins against you all the way up to 490 would require some serious, grudge-bearing sin accounting! Jesus is expressing that the number of times we forgive should be more than we can even keep count of.</p>
