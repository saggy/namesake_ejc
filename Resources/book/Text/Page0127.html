        <p class="Body" i="28">Solitary prayer, like Daniel practiced from the window that faced Jerusalem
          in his room each day, is an important part of the Christian life. As important as it is to
          pray alone, it is also vital to our spiritual health to gather and worship together.
          Getting together with brothers and sisters of faith makes our individual voices of praise,
          confession, and petition one strong common voice lifted to God. Worshipping together helps
          keep us from wandering off on our own diversions, bonds us with other believers, and
          reminds us that we are never alone.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="29">Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah had the benefit of being together in
          exile. While they didn’t have their families or their homeland, they had each other, a
          fact that likely helped sustain them and guide them in the tough choices they were forced
          to make.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="31">
          <span class="char-style-override-21" i="32">When has a community of faith sustained you through a
            difficult time in your own life?</span>
        </p>

        <div class="answer" id="a33" onclick="answer(this)" question="When has a community of faith sustained you through a difficult time in your own life?" i="33"></div>

        <p class="Body" i="34">There are stories from many other wars in history that show how faith and
          solidarity sustained men and women like Daniel and his friends after they had been
          captured by the enemy—stories of prisoners of war passing Bibles back and forth and
          whispering verses and hymns through cell walls. These acts, though small, gave them hope.
          Although we aren’t imprisoned, we do live in a land that is not our home. Knowing that we
          are not alone in our faith has an amazing effect of helping us stay spiritually alive in
          the most difficult of times.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="35">Worship is the redirection of our hearts to the heart of God. It’s the
          corporate gathering of God’s people into one family. It’s the pure oxygen we need to
          breathe to keep our faith alive! Find a time this week that you can gather with other
          believers, direct your attention and worship to God, and breathe deeply.</p>
