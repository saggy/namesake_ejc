          <p class="Body">When I start to feel a little underprivileged compared to those who
          witnessed God’s miraculous works firsthand, it helps me to read Naomi’s story. When she
          felt lost and alone in her grief, she didn’t see any burning bushes or get any celestial
          words of comfort. God didn’t part a Red Sea in order for her to travel home, He didn’t
          raise her loved ones from the dead, and He didn’t miraculously multiply anything to feed
          her and her widowed daughter-in-law. God’s works are invisible here, and yet God’s
          presence is certainly felt throughout this book.</p>

        <p class="Body">
          <span class="char-style-override-21">Read <span onclick="biblepop('2Cor.4.17')">2
              Corinthians 4:17</span>-18. What are we to fix our eyes on?</span>
        </p>

        <div class="answer" id="p96la2" onclick="answer(this)" question="Read 2 Corinthians 4:17-18. What are we to fix our eyes on?"></div>

        <p class="Body">One of my favorite phrases in Naomi’s story is found toward the beginning of
          chapter 2. It’s actually a turning point in the story, flipping a switch from tragedy to
          hope: “As it turned out, [Ruth] found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who
          was from the clan of Elimelech” (v. 3). The phrase “As it turned out” could also be
          translated “As luck would have it.”</p>

        <p class="Body">This is one of the greatest understatements in the Bible! The fact that Ruth
          “coincidentally” ended up in the fields belonging to Boaz, the one person in all of
          Bethlehem with the position and compassion to help Ruth and Naomi, is what brings about
          the eventual happy ending for all of the members of this family.</p>

        <p class="Body">“As luck would have it . . . ” “Luck” would have to be smart enough, loving
          enough, intentional enough, and powerful enough to make sure that of all the fields
          surrounding Bethlehem, Ruth would find herself in the one place that could turn this story
          around and drastically change her future—and Naomi’s—forever. Luck often gets credit for
          the things that God is doing behind the scenes.</p>

        <p class="Body">When we experience something that is inexplicably helpful, timely, or
          uncanny in the way it specifically meets our needs, we often refer to it as a coincidence.
          I believe there are fewer true coincidences than we think. As Christians, we need to come
          to recognize that many of the happy coincidences in life are actually God working behind
          the scenes for our good. I’ve heard others refer to them as “God-incidences”—a way of
          shifting our gratitude from the happenstance forces of fate to the intentional goodness of
          God.</p>

        <p class="Body">To Naomi’s credit, she recognized right away that God was at work. She was
          quick to blame God when things went wrong, but now she was quick to praise Him when she
          saw something happening that she knew was too wonderfully planned to be coincidental.</p>
