          the stakes with what He offered them next.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="24">That’s quite an offer! Just ask me for anything in my name and I will do it.
          This is the verse that has encouraged Christians through the ages to add “in Jesus’ name”
          at the end of our prayers just before the “Amen.” Some have wondered if this offer is
          something like a spiritual blank check—as if whatever we ask, if capped off with Jesus’
          name at the end, will come true.</p>

          <span class="char-style-override-21" i="27">Have you ever wished for just the right words that

        <p class="Body" i="29">Remember, though, that in the Bible a name is the embodiment of someone’s
          character. It tells the story of who the person is—his or her nature or inner compass.
          When Jesus invites us to pray in His name, He wants our prayers to be shaped by His
          character, His desires, His essence. This means that we have to be even more self-aware,
          asking ourselves the motivation behind our prayers. Are we praying to get what we want, or
          are we praying that the world will become what God wants? When we pray, do we pray to
          change God or that God will change us?</p>

        <p class="Body" i="30">What makes the offer of prayer in His own name so remarkable is the history
          of how God’s people have viewed God’s name. Our study of God’s self-revelation began with
          the people of God understanding God to be so holy, so different from them, that He was
          unapproachable, unnamable. They were careful not to speak His name aloud or even write it
          for fear that someone might accidentally pronounce it and possibly be struck dead, because
          God’s holiness was too much for a flawed human being to even name.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="31">When Jesus showed up, the disciples’ experience of Him was so different than
          anyone had ever imagined God to be that they weren’t sure what was going on. “Show us the
          Father!” Philip begged, unaware that that was exactly what Jesus had been doing all along.
          After all the mystery surrounding the name of God, Peter and the disciples encountered God
          face-to-face, embodied in human flesh in a way they could understand. Only they
          didn’t.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="32">Who could comprehend being on a first-name basis with
          God when for so many centuries naming God wasn’t even an option? Knowing God’s name
