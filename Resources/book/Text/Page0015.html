      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p15p12" i="47">When your parents chose your name, they likely had a dream in mind. That name had a ring to it when they first spoke it over you—the ring of their hopes and longings for the kind of life they wanted to see you live, the kind of person they wanted to see you become. They may have been picturing your namesake when they gave it to you—someone who gave the name a sense of beauty, integrity, or power for them. Eventually, though, that name became truly your own. It became synonymous with you: with your personality and character. When people speak or think of your name, they picture your face, your heart, their memories of your gifts or your spirit, and your temperament.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p15p13" i="48">As powerful as parents’ dreams are for their children, God’s dreams for us are even more influential. They are the prevailing story spoken over our lives as we grow and become the person God created us to be. Although Abraham and Sarah would forever be connected to the families that named them, they weren’t afraid to step out of the path they were expected to follow and into the plans of God. When we begin to ask questions about God’s dreams for us, we may find an even greater story than the one we began the day the ink dried on our birth<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="49"></p>
