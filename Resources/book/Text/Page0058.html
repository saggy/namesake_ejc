          takes work and trust, and it is nurtured by worship, praise, and gratitude. These acts
          change our perspective. They help us focus on God’s blessings in our own lives instead of
          looking over the fence at someone else’s blessings; they help us treasure our own
          birthright and blessing instead of trading them away because we long for what is just out
          of reach.</p>
