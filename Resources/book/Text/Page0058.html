    <p class="Body">Contentment doesn’t come on like a light bulb when we flip a switch. It takes work and trust, and it is nurtured by worship, praise, and gratitude. These acts change our perspective. They help us focus on God’s blessings in our own lives instead of looking over the fence at someone else’s blessings; they help us treasure our own birthright and blessing instead of trading them away because we long for what is just out of reach.</p>

    <p class="Body">Knowing the love of our heavenly Father means knowing there will always be more than enough to go around.</p>
