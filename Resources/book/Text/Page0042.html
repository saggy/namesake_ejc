          <li class="PoetryText1" id="p42ul1"><sup>19</sup> This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the 
father of Isaac, <sup>20</sup> and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of 
Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.</li>
		<li class="PoetryText1" id="p42ul2"><sup>21</sup> Isaac prayed to the L<span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span> on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The L<span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span>
answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. <sup>22</sup> The babies jostled each 
other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire 
of the L<span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span></li>
		<li class="PoetryText1" id="p42ul3"><sup>23</sup> The L<span class="char-style-override-19">ord</span> said to her</li>
		<li class="PoetryText1" id="p42ul4">“Two nations are in your womb,</li>
		<li class="PoetryText1" id="p42ul5">and two peoples from within you will be separated;</li>
		<li class="PoetryText1" id="p42ul6">one people will be stronger than the other</li>
		<li class="PoetryText1" id="p42ul7">and the older will serve the younger.”</li>
		<li class="PoetryText1" id="p42ul8"><sup>24</sup> When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. <sup>25</sup> The 
			first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him 
			Esau. <sup>26</sup> After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was 
			named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.</li>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Reflect and Respond</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p42p3">I always thought it would be fun to have twins. Matching babies are so cute 
dressed up in identical outfits, wheeled out on display in a double stroller for the 
world to stop and coo over. The reality of having two babies at once is so much 
different than the dream world of matching outfits and adorable pictures. A close 
friend, blessed with twin girls, shared that there were moments when motherhood of multiples seemed an impossible job. Her pregnancy and delivery were 
much more complicated and difficult. The girls arrived early and were in the 
NICU for weeks. And then, to her horror, they sent her and her husband home 
with both of them—trusting that they would know what to do! In the early days 
it seemed like one or both of the babies was always crying.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p42p4">Rebekah and Isaac must have felt as ill prepared as any first-time parents. 
They had waited so long for these twin babies through the grueling journey of 
infertility. Rebekah’s pregnancy was so difficult that she cried out to God, asking 
Him what was going on within her.</p>
