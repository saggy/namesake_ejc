        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p42p3" i="41">I always thought it would be fun to have twins. Matching babies are so cute 
dressed up in identical outfits, wheeled out on display in a double stroller for the 
world to stop and coo over. The reality of having two babies at once is so much 
different than the dream world of matching outfits and adorable pictures. A close 
friend, blessed with twin girls, shared that there were moments when motherhood of multiples seemed an impossible job. Her pregnancy and delivery were 
much more complicated and difficult. The girls arrived early and were in the 
NICU for weeks. And then, to her horror, they sent her and her husband home 
with both of them—trusting that they would know what to do! In the early days 
it seemed like one or both of the babies was always crying.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p42p4" i="42">Rebekah and Isaac must have felt as ill prepared as any first-time parents. 
They had waited so long for these twin babies through the grueling journey of 
infertility. Rebekah’s pregnancy was so difficult that she cried out to God, asking 
Him what was going on within her.</p>
