        <p class="Body" id="p35p4" i="19">There are certain kinds of change I resist with my whole being. I don’t like
          it when friends move away. I would rather sing my heart out to my favorite songs in
          worship than learn new songs or new styles of music. I don’t want to change shampoos
          because mine went off the market or switch doctors because my insurance says I have to.
          But there are also certain kinds of change I long for. These usually have to do with me. I
          want to be different because my life belongs to God. I want to look back and see that I’ve
          grown less selfish and more forgiving. I want to be noticeably more like Jesus than I was
          a year ago, or even more than I was this morning when I woke up. I long to be
          transformed.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p35p5" i="20">As I mention in the Introduction, the two main themes of Namesake are
          transformation and revelation. The first four days each week will deal with
          transformation, learning about the change God has brought about in others’ stories and
          seeking change in our own lives. Revelation, the topic of the last day of each week, will
          uncover the unchanging identity and character of God, revealed to us in Scripture.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p35p6" i="21">Transformation is a must for believers. Asking questions and learning about
          how we can change is helpful, but all of our acquired information and introspection would
          be incomplete if we didn’t learn about the character and name of the One who is the reason
          and power behind our change. True change is found in discovering who God is, how God
          reveals Himself and His love to us, and how it makes a difference in our own lives. Only
          when we begin to see His unchanging character do we find ourselves wanting to change to be
          more like Him. My desire to be transformed would be a confused circling of my own
          misguided ideas if I didn’t have Jesus as a model of heart and actions. Changing ourselves
          means first learning about the God who provides both the model and the power to
          change.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" id="p35p7" i="22">From the very beginning of creation we see God
          revealing Himself to us, sharing aspects of His character and love, and inviting us to
          learn more in a relationship with Him. God was never required to clue us in to any of
          this. He could have remained aloof, unknowable. Imagine what a frustrating and hopeless
          experiment this life would be if we had no knowledge of the God who created us and loves
          us intimately!</p>
