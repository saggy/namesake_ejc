        <p class="Body" i="41">God wants us to know that the laws He gave us weren’t just for external
          consideration. He doesn’t want us to keep His commands out of duty or obligation but
          because the desire to obey is written on our hearts out of love for Him. He doesn’t want
          His people to use the law as a weapon of judgment, raising it over our heads like a stone
          to throw and hurt people when they break it. God’s hope is that His desires would become
          our desires. He wants not just a set of rules but a relationship.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="48">In Scripture, God uses the metaphors of different kinds of relationships to
          explain who He is and how He relates to us: King and subject, Father and child, Shepherd
          and sheep. One of those relationships that really speaks to the heart of God for His
          people is the bond of Groom to bride, Husband to wife.</p>
