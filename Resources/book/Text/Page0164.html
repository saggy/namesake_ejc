    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">to as Simon Peter, a nod to his old and new nature mixed together in one. Becoming Peter didn’t mean that Simon was lost.</p>

      <p class="Body">If we’re honest, most of us are also a mix of the old and the new, a work in progress with Jesus gradually helping us subtract the negative and add the positive. If we learn anything from Peter, it’s that it certainly takes some time to work out our spiritual kinks.</p>

      <p class="Body">If the disciples had been students of Jesus, learning from Him for three years, the last few days they spent with Him were definitely an accelerated course. The day before the crucifixion was like a final exam for all the disciples, but especially for Peter. He crammed more learning and life change into his last few days with Jesus than many of us can imagine absorbing in a lifetime! The story of this day is told in several of the Gospel accounts. The following Scriptures piece together some of the events.</p>
