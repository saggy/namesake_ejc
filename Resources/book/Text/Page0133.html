        <p class="Body">An awareness of the ways our hearts easily slip into the worship of other
          things is the first step in turning them back to God. When we remind ourselves again that
          He is the source of our comfort and strength, the giver of every good and perfect gift,
          the choice to worship Him with our whole lives flows naturally. I hope that you have
          discovered the joy of worshipping the One who unburdens, who lifts up, who brings peace
          and contentment. In a world filled with competitors for our attention, He is the one
          choice as object of our affection who will give more love than He could ever receive.</p>
