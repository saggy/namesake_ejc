	<p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-21">When you pray to God, are you more likely to imagine Him as immanent or transcendent? Why?</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">When Jacob asked God His name, God refused to give it to him. When Moses asked, God simply answered: “I <span class="char-style-override-14">am</span>.”</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">For both of these men, God revealed more about Himself through His actions than through any name spoken aloud. Instead of offering them a name they could call to have power over Him, God revealed His nature to them by intervening with power in the events of their lives.</p>

    <p class="Body">I love the fact that God isn’t aloof or deliberately mysterious. He is constantly revealing, through His actions in our lives and our world, who He is and what He is capable of.</p>

    <p class="Body">In Week 1 we saw the self-revealing nature of God in the lives of Abraham and Sarah. Although they never asked for God’s name, God proclaimed to them:<br />
    <span class="char-style-override-17">I will. I will. I will.</span> (See Week 1: Day 2.) God made a promise and followed through with actions. Not only is God a God of being (I <span class="char-style-override-14">am</span>); our God is a God of action, of doing (I will).</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-4"><span class="char-style-override-28">I</span> <span class="char-style-override-37">am</span> is a statement of who God is.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-4"><span class="char-style-override-28">I will</span> is a statement of what God does.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">God reveals Himself to us by declaring who He is through the words of Scripture, but He doesn’t stop there. He also names Himself by putting those words into action, revealing His power, love, and forgiveness in our lives. This high and lofty God, who is so powerful that many dared not even speak His name out loud, is constantly naming Himself by giving visible proof of His attributes. What’s better, a God who tells you that He’s powerful, loving, patient, and good, or a God who shows you these traits in every interaction He has with His people? If given the same choice in my relationships with people, I’d choose actions over words every time. Better to have a friend who silently acts on her or his good will than who professes good and then acts differently when your back is turned. Thankfully, we serve and love a God who will never separate words and actions.</p>

    <p class="Body">One of the awesome things about God is that His “I will” and His “I <span class="char-style-override-14">am</span>” are never out of step with each other. When someone’s actions are consistent and reflective of his or her character, he or she has integrity. God exists in a state of integrity, literally the integration of who He is and what He does. In other words, God always acts in ways defined by who He is at His core.</p>
