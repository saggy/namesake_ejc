    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">years later, but Hiyab’s father died of AIDS before he was born. When she found 
out she was pregnant and HIV positive, Hiyab’s mother did everything she 
could to educate herself about protecting her baby’s health. Because she decided 
to give birth in a hospital (not the norm in her culture) and take special measures 
to protect him, her baby was born HIV negative. She named him Hiyab, which 
means “God’s Gift.”<p>
    	 <p style="text-align: justify;">Hiyab Daniel is a gift to his family beyond anything they had dreamed of 
when they prayed and prepared for him. Barry and Erika never imagined what 
a gift they were giving to their first three children, who adore their little brother. 
The journey hasn’t always been an easy one. During his first week in their home, 
Hiyab screamed constantly. He was afraid of the dark and had to sleep in Barry 
and Erika’s bed, waking at the smallest sound. He was even afraid of Barry, since 
his exposure to men had been minimal. But his family’s consistent patience and 
love transformed a scared little boy who spoke no English into a chatty and precocious preschooler who is the light of their lives and often the center of attention 
in his church and community.<p>	
    	 <p style="text-align: justify;">“We plan to take him back to visit Ethiopia one day,” Erika says. “We want 
him to know his story, his heritage. We want him to know where he comes from 
and the amazing sacrifices his birth mother made so that he can have the life he 
has today.” Knowing where he comes from will be an important part of Hiyab 
Daniel’s life and identity as he grows into the man God is forming him to be.<p>	
    	 <p style="text-align: justify;">This week we turn our focus to Daniel. The biblical story of Daniel is one of a 
young man being raised in a foreign culture, not by loving, adoptive parents, but 
by a tyrannical government that destroyed his homeland. Daniel moves forward 
with confidence and integrity in a culture that is foreign to him, but he always 
maintains the identity of where he came from. His history and homeland, like 
Hiyab’s, will always be a part of him. Daniel never forgot where he came from 
or the God who went with him no matter where he lived or what name he was 
called.<p>
