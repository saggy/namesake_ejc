Help us to feel so comfortable with You that we share our deepest desires, needs, hurts, and joys. We’re grateful that You didn’t ask us to say some ritualistic formula in prayer; You ask so much more. You ask for all of us, surrendered to You. We pray that everything we put before You would reflect Your Lordship, Your character, and Your love. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.</span></p>
