him, and he sat down to teach them.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>
The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought 
in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>
and said to Jesus, 
“Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>
In the Law Moses commanded

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Reflect and Respond</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Learning someone’s name is usually the first step in getting to know that person. You probably wouldn’t ask about the person’s 
        	occupation or family until 
you at least knew his or her name. You certainly wouldn’t think of asking about 
his or her deepest hurts, wildest dreams, or closest moment to God if you had 
never even been properly introduced.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Somehow the Bible didn’t get the memo about the etiquette of introductions. 
Scripture is full of some of the most famously anonymous people that ever lived. 
It feels awkward sometimes to read the stories of the intimate details of people’s 
lives and never learn their identity. We often know their heart’s desire, the depth 
of their pain, the way that Jesus changed their destiny, and yet we can’t even call 
them by name. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We call them things such as the blind beggar, the man lowered through the 
roof by his friends, the woman at the well, the rich young ruler, the woman who 
washed Jesus’ feet, the boy with the five loaves and two fish, Potiphar’s wife, 
Lot’s wife, Noah’s wife, and Job’s wife. They were important enough to make it 
into the Bible, but somehow, no one thought to catch their names. We’ve assigned 
each one a nickname based on his or her circumstances, actions, or relationships, 
whether good or bad.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the following stories, what are some of the intimate details we know about 
the unnamed individuals? What names would you give them based on their 
circumstances?</p>
