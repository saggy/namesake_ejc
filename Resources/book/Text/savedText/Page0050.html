    	 <p class="Body">Why settle for one bowl of food when someday you will own all the bowls in the house, not to mention the house itself? I’d like to look down my nose at Esau for his shortsightedness, but the truth is that instant gratification sometimes gets the best of all of us. At one time or another, we’ve all looked at something right in front of us that, if chosen, would mean serious long-term consequences, and cried out, “Go for it!” Short-term pleasure is gratifying, but long-term regrets can be shattering. We know they were for Esau.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24">Have some stew. Lose your birthright. By no means a fair deal.</p>

    <p class="Body">Jacob, too, experienced a gain and a loss in that moment. He gained exactly what he set out to grab in the first place. But what he lost was of great value as well. First, he lost a brother. They shared a womb, and parents, and a home, and now there was a rift there that would take an act of God to repair. He also lost any sense of goodness in himself as he surrendered to the dark side of his name. He spent the first half of his story struggling to take what was not rightfully his. We’ll see him complete the plan and then spend the second half of his life running away from the mistakes he made.</p>

    <p class="Body">Jacob’s epic struggle with the motivations within himself pulled him in two very different directions. His struggle raises an important question we must ask ourselves: <span class="char-style-override-17">Do I grab onto things for my own gain while leaving my relationships in the dust?</span> There’s a saying I love about the best rule to use when determining priorities: “People are more important than things.” It seems simple, but that lesson is hard to learn when you’re a small child whose brother or sister has a toy that you want. It’s just as hard to learn when you’re a grownup, hungry to fill some urge that will inevitably diminish a relationship that matters to you. What we fail to see when we grab what we want in the short-term is that the relationships we overlook are worth far more in the long-term.</p>

    <p class="Body">Learning to put relationships with others before personal gain is definitely not something that comes naturally. God urges us to break the easy pattern of putting ourselves first.</p>
