    <p class="Body">• Find a way to serve this week. It might be something as simple as spontaneously loaning a helping hand to someone while you are out and about, to taking a meal or making a visit to someone who is ill or shut in, to giving several hours to a service opportunity in your local church or community.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-3-9 char-style-override-17">“I am your servant Ruth,” she said. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a kinsman-redeemer.”</span></p>
