<p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-2 char-style-override-18">2</span><span class="text-ruth-2-2 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor. ”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-2 char-style-override-17">Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.”</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-3 char-style-override-18">3</span><span class="text-ruth-2-3 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-18">4</span><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “The L</span><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-19">ord</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-17">be with you!”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-17">“The L</span><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-19">ord</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-17">bless you!” they called back.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-5 char-style-override-18">5</span><span class="text-ruth-2-5 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, “Whose young woman is that?”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-6 char-style-override-18">6</span><span class="text-ruth-2-6 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;The foreman replied, “She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi.</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-7 char-style-override-18">7</span><span class="text-ruth-2-7 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.’ She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-8 char-style-override-18">8</span><span class="text-ruth-2-8 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;So Boaz said to Ruth, “My daughter, listen to me. Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-9 char-style-override-18">9</span><span class="text-ruth-2-9 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-10 char-style-override-18">10</span><span class="text-ruth-2-10 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me —a foreigner? ”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-11 char-style-override-18">11</span><span class="text-ruth-2-11 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Boaz replied, “I’ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-12 char-style-override-18">12</span><span class="text-ruth-2-12 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;May the</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-17">L</span><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-19">ord</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-12 char-style-override-17">repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-17">L</span><span class="text-ruth-2-4 char-style-override-19">ord</span><span class="small-caps char-style-override-19">,</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-12 char-style-override-17">the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-12 char-style-override-19">”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-13 char-style-override-40">13</span><span class="text-ruth-2-13 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;“May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,” she said. “You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-14 char-style-override-18">14</span><span class="text-ruth-2-14 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-14 char-style-override-17">When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-15 char-style-override-18">15</span><span class="text-ruth-2-15 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, “Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don’t embarrass her.</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-16 char-style-override-18">16</span><span class="text-ruth-2-16 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Rather, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don’t rebuke her.”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-17 char-style-override-18">17</span><span class="text-ruth-2-17 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.</span> <span class="text-ruth-2-18 char-style-override-18">18</span><span class="text-ruth-2-18 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="text-ruth-2-19 char-style-override-18">19</span><span class="text-ruth-2-19 char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!”</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-38"><span class="text-ruth-2-19 char-style-override-17">Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said.</span></p>
