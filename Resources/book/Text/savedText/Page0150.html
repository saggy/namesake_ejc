      <p class="Body">Those written records of our lives and thoughts can bring a different kind of gift when we go back and read them months or years later. I love looking through some of my early notebooks from middle school and high school. They’re filled with tales of the battles in teenage friendships, scribblings about boys I liked, and lists of what I was hoping to grow up to be someday. Later journals remind me of the spiritual struggles of young adulthood, working to let go of childish ways and allow God to transform me.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">One thing those journals reveal is the way history repeats itself. Often I fight with the same temptations and struggles from one year to the next. In one notebook I promise God that I’ve learned my lesson, but when I open the next journal I find I’ve fallen into the same potholes again. I’d love to say that my life with God has been one of constant improvement, but my life is sometimes better described as two steps forward and one step back. The proof is there in my own handwriting.</p>

      <p class="Body">Peter’s story reads like a journal of life’s ups and downs. If we could read the stories about him in the Gospels from <span class="char-style-override-17">his</span> point of view, we would likely hear about his excitement and apprehension upon leaving his whole life behind to follow Jesus. We would learn how his world was shaken when Jesus changed his name to “Rock” and declared that he would use him as a foundation on which to build the church. But right alongside his exhilaration and accomplishment, we’d also hear of his setbacks, the way his flaws tended to rear their ugly heads again and again.</p>

      <p class="Body"><span>If we could read Peter’s own journals through the years, we would see that some of the same struggles he had before meeting Jesus popped up again in the years that followed. Like most of us, his old life seemed to follow him like a shadow. He possessed both a desire to change and a resistance to change that makes his life resemble a spiritual yo-yo. While Peter did change and grow as he walked with Jesus, the same flaws he had as a brash fisherman when Jesus called him beside the sea were still present even after he became the leader of the disciples.</span></p>

      <p class="Body">Yesterday we read about Peter’s transforming, name-changing moment when he declared Jesus to be the Messiah and Jesus declared him to be the Rock on which the church would be built. But today, as we continue reading in the same chapter of Matthew, the story immediately following Peter’s high point shows us one of his deepest valleys.</p>
