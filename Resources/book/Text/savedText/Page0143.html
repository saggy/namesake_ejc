    	 <p style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, our medical team was focused on helping me not to deliver 
a baby while my husband was away in another part of the hospital. My labor 
was progressing, and I was worried that Jim would miss the delivery, something 
we never imagined would happen. My blood pressure was going up for several 
reasons, and the staff was trying to calm me down  and  reassure me that Jim 
would be fine.<p>
    	 <p style="text-align: justify;">The anesthesiologist tried to distract me. “Let me tell you a funny story,” he 
said. “Once I was delivering a baby for a woman who spoke very little English. 
She was a pretty tough-looking lady, but she seemed a bit scared, so I had the 
father stay in the room during the epidural. He did the same thing your husband 
did! He passed out cold—head hit the floor. We were all trying to rouse him. I 
was standing behind this woman, and she had a huge tattoo with the name ‘Jose’ 
in large letters covering her back. So I began to yell at the man on the floor: ‘Jose! 
Jose! Wake up!’ He opened his eyes and gave me a very strange look, and the 
pregnant woman looked over her shoulder and very coldly said: ‘His name is 
Pedro.’ I guess that tattoo wasn’t for him after all!”<p>	
    	 <p style="text-align: justify;">His story worked. I laughed out loud. Jim returned soon after with a clean bill 
of health, and our little Kate was born without much delay. We were so grateful 
for a positive outcome, an amazing hospital staff, and the safe arrival of our baby 
girl. If she had been a boy, we might have had to consider the name Pedro just to 
remember the strange happenings of that day!<p>	
    	 <p style="text-align: justify;">Our biblical story this week is one with plenty of unexpected twists. Simon 
Peter was a man no one would have predicted would become a follower of the 
living God, much less a leader of the church. He was rough around the edges 
to say the least, but Jesus saw in him something  that  God could use. Peter’s 
story is so encouraging to those of us who need our rough edges sanded off by 
God’s grace. He reminds us that God is not only a builder of great creations; 
He also specializes in renovating and rebuilding. No one was more aware of or 
more grateful for that fact than Peter. And just to make you smile, don’t forget 
that if you say it in Spanish, his name is Pedro!<p>
