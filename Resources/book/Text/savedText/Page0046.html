    	 <p class="Body">The challenge in life is to sort out the names on our internal nametags. We need to recognize and accept the names we have been given that God nods and smiles at, ones given by people speaking with God’s Spirit and His character. He definitely uses people as His mouthpieces to push us forward in life to discover the identity that He has created for us.</p>

    <p class="Body">We also need to identify which names are ones that don’t fit God’s vision and identity for us—harmful names spoken in haste or hate or anger, names that we will be better off allowing God to erase. For most of us, discovering and changing those names will be a lifelong endeavor, but awareness is a crucial first step.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Go back and cross out the names you wrote previously that God would not want you to continue to wear on your inner nametag.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">The names that matter, the names that should stick, are the names given us by our heavenly Father. The Bible is full of the beautiful, life-giving names that God so lovingly gives us. Here is just a sample.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read each of the following passages and list the powerful and positive names given to us by God.</span></p>

    <p class="Body">God often speaks to us through His words in Scripture. He can also speak through people who love and affirm us. And on certain occasions He speaks directly to our hearts. The names God gives are the ones that should stick for a lifetime. All others must fade away to make room for His dreams for us.</p>

    <p class="Body"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">If God could replace the negative nicknames on your heart with positive ones, reflecting His feelings and goals for you, what would your new names be? List them below. (Examples: <a id="Anchor-4"></a><a id="Anchor-5"></a>Forgiven, Healed, Child of God, Confident, Beautiful)</span></p>
