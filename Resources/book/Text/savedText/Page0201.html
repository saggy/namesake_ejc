      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">18</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">19</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">20</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">21</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">22</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">23</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;“The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel”—which means, “God with us.”</span></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-18">24&nbsp;</span><span class="char-style-override-17">When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.</span> <span class="char-style-override-18">25</span><span class="char-style-override-17">&nbsp;But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</span></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Names are at the center of the sacred ceremonies we hold as Christians. Baptisms, weddings, funerals—all of them are a mix of the sacred and the intimate. Because they’re so personal in nature, at the heart of each of them is a person’s first name.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">“What name is given this child?” “Do you . . . take . . . to be your lawfully wedded husband?” “We are gathered today to remember and give thanks for the life of...”</p>

      <p class="Body">When I preside over one of these sacred ceremonies, I always make sure I have the first name(s) written in big and bold letters across the top of my notes. Every pastor knows there would be nothing worse than saying the wrong name at a wedding. If you do, the confusion in the eyes of the bride and groom is instant. The glares from the mothers would quickly follow. Even worse would be to say the wrong name at a funeral. You really don’t want to make a mistake at the most personal of moments when someone’s name is involved.</p>
