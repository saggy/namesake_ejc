    	<div style="height: 100%; margin-left: 200px;"><p class="noindentp">counselors taught me about Jesus’ love for me, about His invitation to a lifelong, life-changing relationship, and about His faithfulness. It was the faithfulness part I questioned. If grownups couldn’t keep their promises to each other or to me, how could I trust this God with my heart? How did I know He would keep His word? Would God love me forever, or would He bail when things got tough? Somehow during that week the hardness of my little third-grade heart began to melt. I wanted so badly for someone to love me and stay forever. So I took a chance and said yes to Jesus.</p>

    <p class="Body">Abraham and Sarah didn’t have much experience with a God who made promises and kept them. The religion of their families had been one of polytheism—the belief in many gods. In this practice, their families would’ve had a shrine or altar with multiple idols dedicated to different gods. When they wanted something, they would pick an idol that specialized in that area (for example, a god or goddess of fertility, war, healing, or harvest) and make sacrifices and promises to win that god’s approval and favor. Worshipping at the family altar was often about what they wanted and how to manipulate their false gods to get it, rather than responding to a God who wanted something from them.</p>

    <p class="Body">This God, however, was clearly different than any they had ever heard of before. He sought them out and made contact instead of waiting for them to come to Him. He made promises to them that were about His will instead of them making promises and sacrifices to Him in hopes that He would do their will. Most of all, He was real. And powerful. And loving. And more than capable of fulfilling every promise that He made.</p>
