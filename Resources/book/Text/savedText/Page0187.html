      <p class="Body">Another time the Bible speaks of God writing is in the book of Jeremiah. This time the law God promised to write wouldn’t be inscribed on stone tablets or even a dirt floor:</p>

      <p class="Body">God wants us to know that the laws He gave us weren’t just for external consideration. He doesn’t want us to keep His commands out of duty or obligation but because the desire to obey is written on our hearts out of love for Him. He doesn’t want His people to use the law as a weapon of judgment, raising it over our heads like a stone to throw and hurt people when they break it. God’s hope is that His desires would become our desires. He wants not just a set of rules but a relationship.</p>

      <p class="Body">In Scripture, God uses the metaphors of different kinds of relationships to explain who He is and how He relates to us: King and subject, Father and child, Shepherd and sheep. One of those relationships that really speaks to the heart of God for His people is the bond of Groom to bride, Husband to wife.</p>
