We have His Spirit within us to guide us, the power and example of Jesus’ life, the teachings of those who have led us to Him to sustain us, and the stories of the faithful, such as Daniel and his friends, to inspire and encourage us. Over the next few days we will see how they remained faithful to their God as the stakes continually got higher and higher.</p>
