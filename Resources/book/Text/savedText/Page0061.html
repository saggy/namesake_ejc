    <p class="Body">Judging from the outside, Jacob was a success. He had a large family, livestock, and wealth. But on the inside, he was an absolute mess! In fact, most of his story was a tragedy of his own making. He spent his life grabbing at what was not his, poisoning the relationships that should have sustained him. Instead of being able to enjoy what he worked so immorally to gain, he ran from his mistakes, wrestling with an identity and a past that were toxic to him and to those he loved.</p>

    <p class="Body">Despite his material success, Jacob was dissatisfied. Whether it was maturity, nostalgia, or regret, he began to miss what he had left behind enough to face the consequences of his actions and return to the scene of his crimes. He finally mustered the courage to gather up his entourage (which looked more like a traveling circus than a family road trip) and make the long trek back to his homeland.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20"><span>On the very last leg of his journey, Jacob learned that he was about to encounter the one person he needed to make amends with, his brother, Esau. The night before the confrontation, Jacob took everything he had accumulated—everything and everyone he had grabbed, deceived, or swindled to get—and sent them across a river called Jabbok, which means “Emptying.” Then he sat down alone.</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Finally, Jacob was by himself in the quiet to consider all that he had done with his life. It probably was the first time Jacob had been alone with his thoughts in a long time—only he wasn’t alone for long.</p>

    <p class="Body">Biblical scholars are divided on exactly who this “man” was that wrestled with Jacob in Genesis 32. Was it God, a man, or God’s representative in angelic form?</p>
