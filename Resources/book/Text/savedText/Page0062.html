    <p class="Body">This all-night wrestling match was clearly a Divine encounter. Not only does the reference in Hosea 12 let us know that God was present here; the authority we see the mysterious wrestling partner display in renaming Jacob is the same authority displayed by God in renaming Jacob’s grandparents. Those clues help us see that God showed up in person in Jacob’s hour of need. That night forced Jacob to stop grasping at things and ambitions and grab hold of God Himself. Still, Jacob was bold enough to ask his wrestling partner for a blessing.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20"><span class="char-style-override-21">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('Gen.32.27')">Genesis 32:27</span>.</span> <span class="char-style-override-21">When Jacob asked for a blessing, what did his wrestling partner ask him, and what was Jacob’s answer?</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">The last time Jacob had asked for a blessing (from his father), he had lied, misrepresented himself, and taken on the identity of his brother. This time when Jacob asked for a blessing (from his heavenly Father), he was again asked in return, “What is your name?” His answer was both an introduction and a confession: “I am Jacob,” he said truthfully. Deceiver. Swindler. Taker of what is not mine.</p>

    <p class="Body"><span>God must have been satisfied with that answer, because He knew it took a lot for Jacob to speak the truth at last. Even so, He wasn’t satisfied with the man standing before Him. God wants to hear our honest confession and assessment of who we are and where we find ourselves, but that doesn’t mean He’ll leave us that way. Only when we are honest about our desperate state and our desperate need for Him can He set about changing us to become the ones He wants us to be.</span></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('Gen.32.28')">Genesis 32:28</span>. What new name did God give to Jacob, and why?</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">At that moment, Jacob the Deceiver no longer existed. The man left limping at daybreak was now Israel—which means “He Who Wrestles with God.” The nation that once was promised to Abraham and Sarah now had a name. They were the children of Israel—the ones who wrestle with God.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">But that isn’t the end of the story. Jacob went on to ask the name of his wrestling partner. We will explore this in greater depth tomorrow. For now, take note of the answer Jacob’s wrestling partner gave and how Jacob responded.</p>
