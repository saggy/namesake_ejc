      <p class="Body">I love to read. You might even say that books are a bit of an addiction for me. The evidence is obvious: my home and office are overflowing with bookshelves, which are overflowing with books. I even got engaged in a bookstore!</p>

      <p class="Body">So when one of my favorite authors (and one of my heroes in faith), Ellsworth Kalas, announced in a seminary class that he was about to tell us the three most important books we could ever read in life, I sat up straight and took notice. My pen was poised and ready to scribble down authors’ names and titles. Surely the first one would be the Bible. But what after that? I was sure my life was about to be changed by his choices.
