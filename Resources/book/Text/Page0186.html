      <p class="Body" i="16">After all of the scholarship and study and discussion of what Jesus might have written that day, all we have are just good guesses. We’ll never know what He wrote.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="24">We will come back to Jesus’ statement to the woman’s accusers in a moment. For now, I want to draw your attention to the fact that Jesus wrote not only once but twice in this story. The second time, after Jesus diffused the conflict, He wrote while her accusers trickled away, and He stopped only after they all left.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="25">Why all this writing in the dirt? Why does the Gospel of John even include this detail in the story if it would just leave us with more questions than answers?</p>

      <p class="Body" i="26">It’s interesting that this is the only time in the Gospels we’re ever told Jesus wrote anything. We don’t have a record of Him writing a book or a letter or even His name.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="27">Outside of the Gospel stories, though, we do have images of God writing, inscribing things for us to remember through history. If we look at those other times God wrote, we might have some clues of the purpose of Jesus’ writing in this story. We might be able to match the handwriting of God with the actions of Jesus in this story to find out more about what was going on.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="43">The Ten Commandments were the ultimate standard for those who followed the law of Moses. And let’s not forget that one of those commandments was “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” the one that the accusers were supposedly so incensed that this woman had broken.
