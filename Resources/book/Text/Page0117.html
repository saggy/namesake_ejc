      <p class="Body para-style-override-24" i="24"><span class="text-dan-3-26 char-style-override-17" i="25">So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire,</span> <span class="text-dan-3-27 char-style-override-18" i="26">27</span><span class="text-dan-3-27 char-style-override-17" i="27">&nbsp;and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them.

      <p class="Body" i="42">When we parted ways after high school graduation, most of us were headed to state colleges a couple of hours from home. But not Allie. She had been dreaming since she was a child of attending an out-of-state college. The idea of starting over where no one had a preconceived notion of her and where she could reinvent herself made her giddy with excitement. She even considered calling herself “Allison” just to make the process of transforming her identity complete.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="43">College life didn’t disappoint, and soon Allie had made a group of new friends and was having new adventures. One night just before midterms she was pouring over the study notes for a difficult exam when several girls from her class burst into her dorm room, inviting her to a concert across town. She hesitated and explained that she needed to study, and they ran off to make the next invitation. One girl stayed behind until the others were out of earshot. She told Allie about a secret website where someone had uploaded the answers to the test they were taking the next day. One look and she wouldn’t need to study anymore. She could come to the concert with them and be guaranteed a good grade.</p>
