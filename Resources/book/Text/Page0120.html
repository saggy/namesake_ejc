        <p class="Body">Standing for God when the rest of the world bows down to things that do not
          honor Him forces us to call on God for help, to remember who He has called us to be, and
          to remind ourselves that who we are is not supposed to match up with the crowd around
          us.</p>

        <p class="Body">It’s OK to stand out. In fact, it’s God’s intention for His people to be
          obviously different from everyone else. God created laws for His people that would make it
          obvious to the world around them that they were different. He expected them to act in ways
          that were clearly out of synch with the world around them. This was no accident; it was a
          strategy to make the world take notice. God’s people are different because God is
          different from anything and anyone else.</p>

        <p class="Body">In the King James Version, instead of “God’s people” or “a people belonging
          to God,” the phrase is translated: “A peculiar people.” God’s people are special, unique,
          peculiar. We belong to Him, and He wants it to be obvious to the world. But the world
          doesn’t celebrate peculiarity.</p>
