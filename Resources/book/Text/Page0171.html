    	 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">an amazing thing. Being asked to use it in conversation with Him as a way of having your prayers answered was unbelievable. And so many of us don’t—believe it, that is.</p>

      <p class="Body">We know better than to believe that tacking the phrase “in Jesus’ name” on the end of our wish lists will make them come true. You can’t wish for a new car, revenge on your enemies, world peace, or whatever and think that adding Jesus’ name at the end will clinch the deal.</p>

      <p class="Body">Praying in Jesus’ name is not a formula that guarantees us the answer we want. It’s a sign of intimacy, assuming that we know Him well enough to know what kind of prayer would honor His name. It’s another way of saying “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,” since we’re asking for God’s will—the things that honor His name—to become visibly manifest in our world. It means that praying God’s name comes with the responsibility of learning enough about who God is that we can say those words at the end of a prayer with the confidence that we know what God wants. And our understanding of God’s ultimate will, His ultimate triumph over the powers of darkness, means that if we want what God wants, we will ultimately get what we want.</p>

      <p class="Body">Praying in Jesus’ name is as much a message to us as it is to God—a message of what prayer is really about. We don’t pray to point God to our desires; we pray so that God will point us in the direction of His character, shaping us and our hearts even as we ask Him into the deepest places in our hearts.</p>

      <p class="Body">When we pray in Jesus’ name, we should ask ourselves if the prayer reflects our sincere desire to have those things that reflect Jesus’ lordship, character, and love done on earth as in heaven. This is a good litmus test for our prayers. Let’s walk through it together.</p>
