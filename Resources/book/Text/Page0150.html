        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp" i="13">experiences. Sometimes simply writing out
          our confusion or struggles can bring a solution to light that we hadn’t thought of
          before.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="14">Those written records of our lives and thoughts can bring a different kind
          of gift when we go back and read them months or years later. I love looking through some
          of my early notebooks from middle school and high school. They’re filled with tales of the
          battles in teenage friendships, scribblings about boys I liked, and lists of what I was
          hoping to grow up to be someday. Later journals remind me of the spiritual struggles of
          young adulthood, working to let go of childish ways and allow God to transform me.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="15">One thing those journals reveal is the way history
          repeats itself. Often I fight with the same temptations and struggles from one year to the
          next. In one notebook I promise God that I’ve learned my lesson, but when I open the next
          journal I find I’ve fallen into the same potholes again. I’d love to say that my life with
          God has been one of constant improvement, but my life is sometimes better described as two
          steps forward and one step back. The proof is there in my own handwriting.</p>

        <div class="answer" id="a19" onclick="answer(this)" question="If you could go back through journals describing your life experiences over the years, what themes would repeat themselves?" i="19"></div>

        <p class="Body" i="20">Peter’s story reads like a journal of life’s ups and downs. If we could read
          the stories about him in the Gospels from <span class="char-style-override-17" i="21">his</span>
          point of view, we would likely hear about his excitement and apprehension upon leaving his
          whole life behind to follow Jesus. We would learn how his world was shaken when Jesus
          changed his name to “Rock” and declared that he would use him as a foundation on which to
          build the church. But right alongside his exhilaration and accomplishment, we’d also hear
          of his setbacks, the way his flaws tended to rear their ugly heads again and again.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="22">
          <span i="23">If we could read Peter’s own journals through the years, we would see that some of
            the same struggles he had before meeting Jesus popped up again in the years that
            followed. Like most of us, his old life seemed to follow him like a shadow. He possessed
            both a desire to change and a resistance to change that makes his life resemble a
            spiritual yo-yo. While Peter did change and grow as he walked with Jesus, the same flaws
            he had as a brash fisherman when Jesus called him beside the sea were still present even
            after he became the leader of the disciples.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="Body" i="24">Yesterday we read about Peter’s transforming, name-changing moment when he
          declared Jesus to be the Messiah and Jesus declared him to be the Rock on which the church
          would be built. But today, as we continue reading in the same chapter of Matthew, the
          story immediately following Peter’s high point shows us one of his deepest valleys.</p>
