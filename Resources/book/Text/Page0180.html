      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read <span onclick="biblepop('Deut.19.15')">Deuteronomy 19:15</span> and 17:6. What were the requirements in the law of Moses for accusing someone of breaking one of the laws or for putting someone to death?</span></p>

    	  <div class="answer" id="p180la1" onclick="answer(this)" question="Read Deuteronomy 19:15 and 17:6. What were the requirements in the law of Moses for accusing someone of breaking one of the laws or for putting someone to death?"></div>

      <p class="Body">According to Jewish law, no one could be proven guilty without the testimony of two witnesses. You couldn’t just be “the woman accused of adultery” or “the woman suspected of adultery.” You had to be caught in the act, and you had to be caught by two eyewitnesses. So these men must have gone to a lot of trouble to have two people catch this woman in the act while, at the same time, letting her partner slip out the back door.</p>

      <p class="Body">The way they used her for their own agenda, shaming her in a public place (the Temple, no less) shows just how little concern they had for her as a person. It’s possible that she had been treated with contempt by other men in her life, that she was all too familiar with men who used her for their own purposes without truly knowing her heart, her hurts, or even her name.</p>

      <p class="Body">Now standing before her was one more man. Even if she didn’t know much about Jesus, it was clear immediately that He was teaching in the Temple as a rabbi, a teacher of the very law that she was accused of breaking. One condemning word from Him and she’d be dragged out and stoned. A forgiving word and her life would be spared. She must have wondered what this man would do with her. Her life was in His hands.</p>

      <p class="Body">As onlookers to her story, we have the benefit of information that our frightened, unnamed friend did not have in those anxious moments. We know the Good News that the man standing before her was different than anyone she had ever met. He wasn’t only a man; He was also her Creator and her God, and He loved her more than anyone ever could.</p>

      <p class="Body">As the old country song goes, she had been “looking for love in all the wrong places,” but finally she was standing in the right place. Finally, she was standing face to face with the Source of true love. This was the one place she would find fulfillment of the deep need for love that she had sought to fill in the arms of another man who could never love her enough. And her life would never be the same.</p>

      <p class="Body">Her story is definitely one of the most powerful anonymous stories in the Bible. She is in good company with the scores of other “players to be named later” in salvation history. The one thing they have in common is this: we don’t know their names, but we know they were all changed by a powerful encounter with God.</p>
