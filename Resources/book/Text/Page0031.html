        <p class="Body" id="p31p3">Abraham and Sarah’s lives were full of waiting for their longing for a child
          to be fulfilled. Long after they had hoped to be grandparents, they were still waiting for
          the baby that God had promised twenty-five years earlier. That’s what I call a long time
          to be expecting!</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p31p4">From their perspective it must have seemed that their prayers were getting
          harder and harder to answer because of their age, but to a God who loves a challenge, the
          timing was just right. The more difficult something is to make happen, the more God enjoys
          rolling up His sleeves and impressing the world by doing what only He can accomplish. When
          God makes the impossible happen, we can’t deny that He’s the one behind the results.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p31p11">Often we find that something powerful has happened within us while we were
          waiting. Waiting for the blessing can often be part of the blessing itself, since we have
          to rely on God in new and unexpected ways.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p31p20">Waiting may be one of the few times in life when we are forced to be still
          long enough for God to do some of His most important work in us, molding us into whom He
          wants us to become. Waiting is a struggle because we’re so used to the illusion that we
          control our lives by planning and acting on our plans. We believe that we are the ones who
          make things happen. Waiting strips us of that illusion and forces us to acknowledge the
          God who is in control and our need for Him.</p>
