        <p class="Body" i="13">The imagery of these first two verses is of large, heavy idols placed on the
          backs of donkeys or oxen to be moved. Instead of powerfully lifting burdens, these idols
          themselves become a burden. Instead of freeing people from captivity, they themselves can
          be carried into captivity.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="14">God’s objection to people worshipping false idols is less about His need for
          adoration and more about how horribly it affects our lives when we give our worship away
          to the wrong things. God insists that we worship Him not because He is self-interested but
          because abiding in His character is in the best interest of His children.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="20">God cares about us so much that He wants us to orient our lives to worship
          the only thing that can unburden us, Him! God&nbsp;mourns the fact that while people
          should be bowing to the God who made them and can save them, instead they are carrying
          around heavy idols. In the images of Isaiah 46, God ridicules the idols for themselves
          bowing down because they are causing such a burden to the people and animals forced to
          carry them.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="21">Instead of lifting people’s burdens, these idols cause an extra burden on
          their lives, adding to the burdens they were hoping the idols would help to alleviate. The
          truth is that idol worship damages our lives. It’s a tragic irony that the very idols we
          suppose will save us are the things that destroy us.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="Body" i="22">God loves us so fiercely that He fights to destroy anything that could harm
          us. It’s no accident that when God hands out the Ten Commandments for His people to
          follow, He begins with these two:&nbsp;</p>
