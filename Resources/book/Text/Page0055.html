        <p class="Body" id="p55p6" i="26">Though Esau and Jacob must have felt special at times because of the
          preferential treatment they received, the favoritism shown to one of them no doubt was
          hurtful to the other. Whatever someone’s reason for showing preferential treatment, it
          often communicates to us that we are not good enough, that we haven’t earned the right to
          his or her love.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p55p9" i="31">As today’s reading from God’s Word reveals, Jacob’s chance to finally
          possess both the birthright and the blessing came when his father, Isaac, lay dying. Isaac
          knew he wanted to pass the blessing along to his older son, so he sent Esau out to hunt
          for and prepare a last meal. That’s when Rebekah moved into manipulation mode, engaging
          Jacob in her plan of deceit that would ultimately divide their family.</p>

        <p class="Body" id="p55p15" i="43">Rebekah’s plot involved preparing a meal, dressing Jacob in his brother’s
          clothes that she happened to have ready for such an occasion, and putting goatskins on
          Jacob’s hands and neck to cover his smooth skin. The story suggests this was a
          premeditated act she had been planning for some time as she schemed about how to steal
          from her older son to favor the younger.</p>
