    	<div style="height: 100%; margin-left: 200px;"><p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Read <span onclick="biblepop('John.1.12')">John 1:12</span>-13, <span onclick="biblepop('1Jn.3.1')">1 <span onclick="biblepop('John.3.1')">John 3:1</span></span>-2, and <span onclick="biblepop('Rom.8.15')">Romans 8:15</span>-17.

    <p class="Body">The second thing God promised them was a place—a land that would hold all these future nations, a place they could call home for generations to come.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('Gen.17.8')">Genesis 17:8</span> and fill in the blanks below:</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-23">“The whole ____________ of ____________, where you are now an alien, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you.”</span> <span class="char-style-override-21">(NIV)</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">It would be a land that would be amazingly beautiful and fruitful and belong to their family. Remember that permanent wealth wasn’t determined by currency in the bank but by many children and ownership of land to pass down through the generations. These two promises alone were the equivalent of winning the lottery many times over.</p>

    <p class="Body">Third, and best of all, God promised them a presence—His presence.</p>

    <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-21">Reread <span onclick="biblepop('Gen.17.7')">Genesis 17:7</span>-8 and fill in the blanks below:</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-23">“I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be __________ __________ and the God of your descendants after you. . . . I will be __________ __________.”</span> <span class="char-style-override-21">(NIV)</span></p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

    <p class="Body">He promised to be with them and to be their God—to love and take care of them.</p>

    <p class="Body">God promised Abraham and Sarah three things: the two greatest desires of their hearts—people and place—and a third thing they hadn’t even imagined they could desire, because the presence of a God who loved and cared and guided them through life was unheard of. The greatest promise of all was that He would be with them, establishing a covenant to be their God and the God of their descendants. This third promise was worth more than the others combined—God’s presence with them. The greatest promise of all is God’s presence, His commitment to walk with us as His children.</p>
