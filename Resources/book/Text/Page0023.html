I understood that television commercials promised things their products would never be able to deliver. I felt sure that it was false advertising when my grandmother guaranteed that eating all my vegetables would make me grow up to have big muscles. And I knew that grownups didn’t always keep their promises. <a id="Anchor-3" i="53"></a>By the end of elementary school I had witnessed my own parents’ divorce and their remarriages to other people that were already beginning to crumble. Stepparents, stepbrothers and stepsisters, and step-grandparents were impermanent stars in confused and fading family constellations. People came into my life making vows to one another and to me, but I was learning quickly that they often didn’t hold up their end of those promises. Before I ever hit puberty I learned to look with caution when a grownup made a promise to stay forever.</p>
