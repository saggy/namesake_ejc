    <p class="Body">When we, God’s children, are behaving at our best, He showers us with love and blessings. And when we are at our worst, He still showers us with love and blessings. The idea that God favors one child over another is simply untrue. God’s acts of abundance are in direct contrast with the world’s belief in supply and demand. Unlike Jacob and Esau’s parents, God is a Divine Parent who is able to give with equal abundance, working for the best for each of His children, even when it’s not apparent to us in the present.</p>

    <p class="Body para-style-override-20">My own struggle with contentment didn’t end when our son was born. I’ll admit that even in the midst of joy and praise and thankfulness, I still had my moments of discontent. “I’ll be happy when I have the child I long for” quickly gave way to the cry of “I’ll be happy if he’ll just sleep through the night!” Answered prayers are often quickly followed by new prayer requests—proof that contentment doesn’t lie in having our every whim fulfilled.</p>

    <p class="Body">Contentment is not a product of having everything our hearts desire. It’s a commodity produced by internal, not external, circumstances. Waiting for our situation to change before we’ll be happy means we will always find another longing around the next corner.</p>

    <p class="Body">All of us have areas in our lives where we struggle to be content. If we’re not careful, our discontent will damage our relationships with the people around us. Discontent also damages our relationship with God. A life spent wishing you had what someone else has shortchanges the life God intended you to live. When we become so focused on the blessings in other people’s lives, like Jacob did, we</p>
