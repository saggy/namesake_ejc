      <div i="22">
        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p74p2" i="23"><br i="24"></p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p74p3" i="25">Since the day they found out they were expecting their first child, Jack and 
Jessica had been calling their baby L.J.—a nickname short for Little Jack or Little 
Jessica. When they found out little L.J. was a boy, family tradition dictated that 
this baby boy would be the fourth generation to carry on the family name: John 
McDowell Allen.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p74p4" i="26">After a relatively smooth start to her pregnancy, Jessica woke up one morning 
feeling that something was wrong. She rushed to the hospital and found out she 
was in premature labor only 26 weeks along. John McDowell Allen IV was born 
weighing exactly two pounds, a tiny, handsome little boy. His first pictures show 
his parents’ wedding rings slipped over his perfect little feet like ankle bracelets. 
With his parents’ powerful love and prayers and the support of an amazing medical team,&nbsp;L.J. fought against the odds, but at only 17 days old he succumbed to 
an infection in his blood, something his tiny system just wasn’t equipped to fight. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p74p5" i="27">I’ll never forget standing in front of a packed church, officiating at L.J.’s funeral 
in front of hundreds of people. Part of a funeral service is called the “Naming.” 
In it, the pastor tries to sum up the events and experiences of a person’s life, 
naming his or her time on earth through the contributions the individual has 
made. Using words to “name” L.J.’s contribution on earth made me realize how 
little of our lives can be measured by successes or achievements. It was amazing 
that one who had spent so little time on earth made such an impact on so many. 
In the days following the funeral, Jessica couldn’t shake the feeling that this 
wasn’t how their story was supposed to end.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p74p6" i="28">A couple of months later, their grief still fresh, Jack and Jessica received a phone 
call from a family friend. A teenage girl who was unprepared to be a mother was 
expecting a baby right around the time of L.J.’s due date. Their mutual friend felt 
led by God to contact Jack and Jessica to see if they would consider adopting the 
baby girl. At first they thought it was too soon. They hadn’t had time to heal from 
their recent loss, much less consider their future. But that night they both lay in<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="29"></p>
