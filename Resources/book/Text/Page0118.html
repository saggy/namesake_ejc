    <p class="Body">Allie didn’t even need to consider it. This was part of her identity she didn’t want to give up, the one that honored God even when no one was watching. She passed on the concert and the cheating. Though she was rewarded with a lower grade than some others, she received the confirmation that beneath the new surroundings was a part of her that mattered and that had not changed.</p>

      <p class="Body">Four years later Allie was close to graduating. One of her close friends had just gotten engaged, and some of the girls were treating that friend to a night out to mark the occasion. When dinner was over they all giggled and whispered as they got in the car, heading to their next stop. Allie wasn’t quite sure where they were headed. They drove across town and parked in the parking lot of a strip club, where they would continue the bachelorette celebration. They knew Allie well enough by this time to know that she would’ve found a way to decline if she had known where they were headed. But now she was stuck. Why not come in with them and have some fun? Once again Allie didn’t have to think long about her response. Without an ounce of judgment in her voice, she told them she’d just wait in the car until they were ready to go.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Her polite refusal caused each of them to wonder why she wasn’t OK with going in and to think a little deeper about why they were. One friend felt bad about her being left in the car and told the others she’d drive Allie back to campus and come back for them later. The friend confided in Allie on the way to the dorm that she had felt uncomfortable too but hadn’t had the courage to refuse going along with the crowd. She was impressed that Allie had taken a stand.</p>

      <p class="Body">Allie was able to grow into a new identity without losing who she really was. She learned that growing up didn’t mean growing out of the integrity she had always possessed, both in very private and very public situations.</p>

      <p class="Body">The four young men in our Bible story were taken from Jerusalem with countless others and transplanted into a strange culture with strange customs and language. The Babylonians wanted to make them feel so at home that they forgot who they were and became completely converted to the language, culture, and religion of Babylon. And one of the first steps toward that end was to change their names.</p>
