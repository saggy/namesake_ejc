        <p class="Body">Moses’ encounter with God at the burning bush led him to ask God: “Suppose I
          go to the Israelites and say to them ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and
          they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” (<span
            onclick="biblepop('Exod.3.13')">Exodus 3:13</span>).</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Moses was looking for an endorsement, a name, a base
          of credibility that He could carry back with Him to God’s people. God endorsed the purpose
          and ministry He had given Moses by giving Him a name: “I <span
            class="char-style-override-14">am</span> who I <span class="char-style-override-14"
            >am</span>. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I <span
            class="char-style-override-14">am</span> has sent me to you’” (<span
            onclick="biblepop('Exod.3.14')">Exodus 3:14</span>). Any brilliant leadership decision
          Moses made, any miracle he performed, wasn’t in his own strength or his own name but in
          the name of YHWH, the “I <span class="char-style-override-14">am</span>.” Everything Moses
          did was an endorsement of God’s name and power.</p>

        <p class="Body">The same is true in the story of Daniel and his friends. The famous account
          of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, which we studied on Day 2, ends with them walking out
          of the fiery furnace without a mark on them, unsinged and unharmed. King Nebuchadnezzar,
          who had ordered them burned to death, was impressed, to say the least, but he wasn’t
          impressed with <span class="char-style-override-17">them</span>; he clearly saw that their
          actions pointed beyond them to the God they represented.</p>
