Thank You for Your invitation to approach You on a first-name basis, bearing our hearts and souls to You. As You reveal Yourself to us, we give You ourselves so that we can be transformed. Make us into the beautifully named women of God You long for us to be. In Your holy name we pray. Amen.</span></p>
