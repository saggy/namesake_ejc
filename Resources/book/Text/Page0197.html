It means not only that Jesus wants to forgive us and set us free from our pasts but also that He wants that freedom to stretch into our futures as well. He doesn’t want us to continue on the same path and be damaged by the same mistakes over and over again. He wants to eradicate sin from its iron grip on our lives.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="14">Why does God want to free us from sin? Because of His love for us. Just like a parent trying to protect children from choices that can hurt them, God will do anything to protect us from the damaging presence of sin in our lives. Because sin hurts us so badly, it is God’s enemy.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="45">The woman caught in adultery was a child of God. Jesus loved her and wanted for her a life of wholeness—one she could be proud of. He wanted to protect her from the damage her accusers were trying to inflict, but He also wanted to stop the damage she was inflicting on herself.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="46">Not only did this woman experience the compassion and comfort of Jesus; she experienced conviction as well. Conviction is recognition of your own sin, and it humbles you and moves you to change. Let’s talk a little more about the word <span class="char-style-override-17" i="47">conviction</span>, because when people first experience the awareness of their own sin, they have trouble distinguishing conviction from something else—condemnation.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="48"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="49">Conviction</span> is the internalized voice of God, affirming our worth, gently calling us to a life better than our own impulses and offering us a chance to change.<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="50"></p>
