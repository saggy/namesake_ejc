communication style endears her to her audiences. Currently she is Pastor of Worship
at The Woodlands United Methodist Church in The Woodlands, Texas, a church with
over 8,000 members. In this position she serves as worship architect, planning and
developing four of the church’s seven weekly worship experiences and working with
contractors whose talent in music, media, and preaching build worship services that
shine for the glory of God. Her other projects include leading the development of The
Woodland UMC’s online church initiative and acting as the church’s pastoral liaison and
chaplain to the Asbury Theological Seminary program. Her popular blog “Reverend
Mother” (<span onclick="Ti.App.fireEvent('link_click', {_where: 'http://www.jessicalagrone.com'});">www.jessicalagrone.com</span>) encompasses her dual roles of pastor and mom.
She writes, “This is a blog about having a foot in two worlds, and being imperfect,
inadequate, and available to God in both at the same time.” Jessica enjoys speaking
at retreats and events at churches throughout the United States. She and her husband,
Jim, have two young children, Drew and Kate.</p>
