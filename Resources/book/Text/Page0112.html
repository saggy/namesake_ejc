        <p class="Body para-style-override-20">As our children grow, we teach them that our family
          culture will sometimes differ from those around us: “We don’t do that in our family” or
          “If your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?” Children are absorbing the culture and
          beliefs of the family around the table at meals, in the car as they are going places, and
          often just observing our everyday reactions and responses to the world around us.</p>

        <p class="Body">Once upon a time in ancient Jerusalem, four sets of parents began teaching
          their children what their families believed and what shape their lives were expected to
          take on the day they were born. They did this by giving them their names. The four boys
          were named Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Their parents knew the first lesson
          they wanted to teach their sons: that they should honor and worship God in all they did.
          They felt so strongly about teaching this lesson that they embedded it in their very
          names. Consider the meanings of their names:</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24"></p>

        <p class="Body">Daniel: God Is My Judge</p>

        <p class="Body">Hananiah: Yahweh Is Gracious</p>

        <p class="Body">Mishael: Who Is Like God?</p>

        <p class="Body">Azariah: Yahweh Has Helped</p>

        <p class="Body">Each time these boys heard their names, they heard a message about a
          powerful God who loved and cared for them. The suffix “El” at the end of Daniel’s and<img src="../../images/rarr.png"></p>
