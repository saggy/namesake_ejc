        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="noindentp">those three books, we’ll discover what we
          truly value. Worship is more than just belief. It means orienting our lives to give honor
          to something beyond ourselves. Whatever we put at the center of our lives is what we
          worship.</p>

        <p class="Body">Worshipping an invisible God takes quite a leap of faith. It’s so much
          easier to believe in what we can see and touch with our hands than in a God we cannot see.
          To fix this problem, the Babylonians (and many other cultures like them) made idols,
          physical statues or representations of their gods. These were made of wood or metal and
          placed on an altar where people could worship them, bow to them, and make sacrifices to
          them.</p>

        <p class="Body">As we’ve seen, the leaders of Babylon tried to force Daniel,
          Hananiah,&nbsp;Mishael, and Azariah to take God from the center of their lives and put
          false gods and idols in His place. Since God held a place of honor in their names, the
          Babylonian leaders took away those names and replaced them with names honoring false gods,
          idols. The gods at the center of their new names were&nbsp;Bel, Aku, and Nebo.</p>

        <p class="Body">Daniel became Belteshazzar.&nbsp;Bel signifies the title “Lord” or “Master”
          rather than a proper name. This title was possibly used to signify Marduk, one of many
          Babylonian gods. Hananiah and Mishael became Shadrach and Meshach, with the idol Aku at
          the heart of their new names, the Babylonian god of wisdom. Azariah became Abednego, to
          honor Nebo, the Babylonian god of the moon.</p>

        <p class="Body">The Bible addresses the damaging nature of idol worship in a poetic chapter
          of Isaiah. It actually brings up some of the&nbsp;exact idols mentioned in the new names
          Daniel and his friends received.</p>
