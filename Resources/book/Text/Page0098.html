        <p class="Body">In chapter 1, Naomi tells the women who greet her on her way back into
          Bethlehem not to call her Naomi (Pleasant) anymore, but to call her Mara (Bitter). Then at
          the very end of the book those same women praise God for the circumstances He has used to
          bring her joy.</p>

        <p class="Body">God loves to work in secret and see if we can uncover His goodness. He is
          working not only for our good, for each of our small stories, but also for the good of His
          creation—for the Big Story that is always greater than anything we can wrap our minds
          around. While this is Naomi’s story (in a book with Ruth’s name on the cover), it is so
          much bigger than about just Naomi’s individual life. What appears to be a happy ending for
          her is really a beginning of a new and grander story. The grandson whose birth marks the
          end of her story here, Obed, will grow up to be the grandfather of King David, the most
          influential king Israel ever knew. And as we saw yesterday Jesus Himself, the long-awaited
          Messiah, eventually would descend from his lineage.</p>

        <p class="Body">Ruth’s seemingly accidental choice of fields to glean in is one of many
          God-incidences that had to happen to make the joyful outcome of this story possible.</p>
