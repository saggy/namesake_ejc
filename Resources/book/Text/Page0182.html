    	 <p class="Body">I’m so thankful that this woman’s story is included in God’s Word! She may have been unnamed, but she was not unknown. Jesus knew her, and He loved her. He knows and loves you, too. If you ever feel a little anonymous, unremarkable, unnoticed, know that God notices your every joy and every concern. He is specifically concerned with the specifics of your life. Before you were born, He saw you. Before anyone spoke your name, He knew you. According to Him, you are fearfully and wonderfully made.</p>

      <p class="Paragraph-Style-1"></p>

      <p class="Body"><span class="char-style-override-17">God, when I start to feel unnoticed and unloved, remind me again that You care intimately about me. Let me feel Your pleasure in the little things in my everyday life. Help me to remember that You saw me before anyone else even knew of my existence, and that You have loved me from that moment. And Lord, help me to pay attention to the “anonymous” people I come across. Help me to learn their names and lift them up to You. We are grateful that we all matter to You! Amen.</span></p>

        <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><p class="noindentp">Read Psalm 139, rephrasing some of the lines that stand out to you as if they are written about you (because they are!) by inserting your own name in place of the words <span class="char-style-override-17">me</span> and <span class="char-style-override-17">I</span>.</p>

        <li style="list-style-type: circle;"><p class="noindentp">Learn the names of the anonymous people you come across this week. Address the checker at the grocery store and the bank teller by name. If there’s someone you see week after week, make sure that you learn more about this person. Find ways to help the person feel seen and known. Pray for him or her by name.</p>
