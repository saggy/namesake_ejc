        <p class="Body">The Babylonians took the names that these young men’s parents had given them
          to honor God and replaced them with names that honored the idols worshipped in Babylon.
          Some of the changes even deliberately mocked their original names and the God they had
          been raised to worship. For example, Mishael, which meant “Who Is Like Yahweh?” became
          Meshach, “Who Is Like Aku?”</p>

        <p class="Body">The challenges to their integrity and faithfulness to God were immediate
          upon arrival in Babylon. Not only were they renamed; their first meal called their beliefs
          into question. In Day 1 we saw that in Babylon they were immediately confronted with the
          choice of whether or not to eat food sacrificed to idols, a form of idol worship.</p>

        <p class="Body">We may think, <span class="char-style-override-17">What’s the big deal? It’s
            just a plate of food!</span> Temptation often starts small. Think of Eve and Adam and a
          single piece of fruit. No big deal, right? The small temptations toward a white lie, a
          selfish action, a glance at a website, an unseen act are the most difficult because no one
          will know but God and us. These young men were able to withstand the temptation to gorge
          themselves on delicious food because they knew it would betray the God they loved.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-20">If eating food that had been on the altar of idols
          seemed like a small thing, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were given bigger challenges
          soon enough. They faced a decision about whether to bow down to the ninety-foot-high
          golden idol statue built by King Nebuchadnezzar. They must have stood out, quite
          literally, as the crowd around them bowed, and they were the sole people left standing in
          the presence of the huge idol.</p>
