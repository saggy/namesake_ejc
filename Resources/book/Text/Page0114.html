        <p class="Body" i="19">Where others saw an opportunity to live a new and lavish lifestyle, Daniel
          and his friends refused to defile themselves with food and drink that had been offered to
          Babylonian idols. To eat this food would have meant worshipping those idols. It would have
          meant a betrayal of their God and all that their parents had instilled in them, starting
          with their very names.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="20">These young men stood up to the Babylonians, deprived themselves of one
          incredibly lavish meal after another, and remained true to their names. Their family
          culture was so embedded in them that even when they were removed from it and transplanted
          to a pagan environment, their beliefs did not budge. The words of the moms who had been
          the know-it-alls in their early days still rang in the boys’ minds:</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24" i="21"></p>

        <p class="Body" i="22">If all your friends ate food offered to idols, would you?</p>

        <p class="Body" i="23"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="24">Yahweh is gracious</span>
          (Hananiah)—you can depend on that in the darkest days.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="25"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="26">Yahweh has helped</span> (Azariah) us
          in the past and He will help you through this.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="27">These idols are nothing. There is only one true God. <span class="char-style-override-17" i="28">Who is like Him</span> (Mishael)?</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24" i="29">Don’t worry what others say or think or do. Their
          opinions don’t matter.<br i="30">
          <span class="char-style-override-17" i="31">Only God is your judge</span> (Daniel). Follow His
          instructions and no others.</p>

        <p class="Body para-style-override-24" i="32"></p>

        <p class="Body" i="33">That’s the kind of strength it takes to hold fast to God’s teaching while
          living in a world where even dinner time is a chance to bow to idols, to give your heart
          and life to something besides God.</p>

        <p class="Body" i="34">We know all too well that Babylon is not the only culture ever to entice its
          inhabitants to give their hearts and lives to something besides the one true God.</p>
