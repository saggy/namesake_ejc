    <p class="Body" i="17">Three times Jesus gave him a chance to reform, repent, and answer the most personal question possible, each time using the most personal, first-name address (<span onclick="biblepop('John.21.15')" i="18">John 21:15</span>-17):</p>

      <p class="Body" i="19"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="20"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="21">“Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body" i="22"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="23">“Simon son of John, do you truly love me?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body" i="24"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="25">“Simon son of John, do you love me?”</span></p>

      <p class="Body" i="26"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="27">Suddenly it all added up. It didn’t matter to Jesus who the world said that He was; He had wanted to know, “Who do you say that I am?” It didn’t matter to Him what Simon had done. He wanted to know, “Do you love me?” And three times Simon jumped at the chance to answer “Yes!”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="28">Jesus’ questions are personal. He wants our answers to be equally personal. It doesn’t mater to Him what we have done. It matters to Him what we believe about Him and how we answer the question “Do you love me?”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="29">I often stumble, showing my old colors beneath all the work Jesus has done in me. I tell Jesus “Never!” when I should say, “Anything you ask, Lord.” I fall asleep when I should be standing by Him. I betray and deny Him not once but over and over. And yet He still finds the sum of my behavior to be nothing compared to His great love and sacrifice for me.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20" i="30">For every mistake you make, Jesus adds one more chance. He doesn’t subtract His grace or mercy. He doesn’t take away the chance of a fresh start. He continually goes before you and asks you to follow Him. If you betray Him seven times, He gives you eight chances to redeem yourself. If you mess up seventy-times-seven times, God’s arithmetic responds with seventy-times-seven-plus-one offers of forgiveness, followed by an invitation just like the first: “Follow me.”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="31">Jesus always offers us another chance to answer that singularly most important question: “Do you love me?”</p>

      <p class="Body" i="32">Yes, Lord. A thousand times, yes!</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-24" i="33"></p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-24" i="34"></p>

      <p class="SUB1" i="35">Pray About It</p>

      <p class="Paragraph-Style-1" i="36"></p>

      <p class="Body" i="37"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="38">Dear Jesus, we are so grateful for the way you handle the ups and downs of our lives. While we are all over the map with our thoughts, actions, and responses, You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Thank You for Your patience when I need to be forgiven again and again. Help me to have the same patience, the same grace, when dealing with other people in my life. And, Lord, in response to Your question “Do you love me?” we answer “Yes, yes, yes!” Amen.</span></p>
