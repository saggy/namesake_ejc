      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">When I was growing up, I had a picture of Jesus in my head when I prayed. He looked a lot like the pictures in the children’s Bible that was always in the waiting room at my dentist’s office. He was kind and loving, with soft brown hair and big eyes, and he listened intently when I talked. When I had tough moments, I imagined him physically walking beside me and holding my hand as I encountered things that made me worried or scared. Holding onto that image in prayer helped me through a lot of difficult experiences. But sometimes this passive, listening Jesus was easy to ignore when I wanted to do things my own way. I forgot at times that the kindness of God is also wrapped in holiness, and that God has expectations for me and desires for my life to change.</p>

      <p class="Body">My mom tells me that while she was growing up, her picture of God was anything but kind and loving. She pictured an old man with a harsh expression, constantly looking over her shoulder, waiting for her to mess up. When she did, He was the last person she would want to go to for help. She was afraid He would judge or punish her. It wasn’t until her adult years that she learned the unapproachable God she had imagined in childhood had come to earth as a very approachable person in the flesh. The Jesus she experienced as her faith matured offered her compassion and understanding, especially since He experienced all the same trials and temptations that we do during His ministry on earth.</p>

      <p class="Body para-style-override-20">Even the disciples had a hard time getting their picture of God in focus. They walked with Jesus day after day, and yet they couldn’t quite comprehend who He really was or what He was trying to show them. Can we blame them? Understanding God is arguably the biggest concept a human mind can ever hope to grasp.</p>

      <p class="Body"><span>Philip is a perfect example. When Jesus declared that the disciples knew the Father and had seen the Father, Philip still persisted in asking: “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.14.8')">John 14:8</span>). Jesus responded: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time?” (<span onclick="biblepop('John.14.9')">John 14:9</span>).</span></p>

      <p class="Body">I often imagine Jesus asking me the same question: “Don’t you know me, Jessica, even after I’ve been with you for so long?” After all these years of calling myself a Christian, reading the Bible, and talking with God in prayer, I still feel a little in the dark sometimes about who God is and what He wants from me.</p>

      <p class="Body">Learning who God is takes more than reading a book or two or attending a seminar. It takes a lifetime of walking with Him and searching to know Him, and</p>
