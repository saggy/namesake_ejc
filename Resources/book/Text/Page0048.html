        <h3 style="text-align: center;" i="19">Reflect and Respond</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p48p2" i="20">I grew up longing for a sister who would be a friend and playmate. In my 
daydreams, she and I would share clothes, do each other’s hair, and tell secrets 
that made us laugh. While I was great at sisterly love in my daydream world, I 
wasn’t very good at it in the closest sister relationship I had in real life. During 
my elementary school years, we lived one block away from my stepfather’s sister 
and her family. I had two step-cousins who were very close to me in age. Chelsey, 
the oldest of the two, was only a year behind me in school. We grew up playing 
together daily, sleeping over at each other’s houses, going to the same school, and 
getting involved in the same activities. That last part was where things started to 
get tough. I was excited to start taking dance lessons. Chelsey signed up for the 
same class and pirouetted beside me at the recital. I joined the children’s choir 
at church. Chelsey and I competed for the same solos. I signed up for the tennis 
team. Guess who was there, across the net, hitting balls back in my face? </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p48p3" i="21">Although we didn’t live in the same house, my feelings for Chelsey were a lot 
like those my friends described having toward their siblings. One minute I loved 
having a friend and a playmate who was around all the time; another minute I 
was overwhelmed with feelings of jealousy and competition. I didn’t like sharing 
the family spotlight. I treated her one minute like the sister I longed for and the 
next like a distrusted adversary. As we got older and the issues of competition 
had higher stakes, I pushed our friendship further and further away. Looking 
back, I wish I’d embraced what could have been a lifelong closeness instead of 
holding her at arm’s length.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p48p4" i="22">Siblings, cousins, and other close family members are often our first playmates, our first friends, 
        	and our first enemies—our first reality check that the 
world does not revolve around us. They help us define who we are and how we 
will treat others for a lifetime. </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p48p5" i="23">This certainly was true for Jacob and Esau. Their sibling rivalry began early: 
in the womb. As we read yesterday, their mother even cried out to God because 
their prenatal scuffles were so painful. As soon as they were born, their inheritance and place in the family was sealed for life.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;" id="p48p6" i="24">When his twin brother, Esau, beat him to the finish line to be born first by 
a matter of minutes, Jacob’s position for life was supposedly decided. As the 
second-born, Jacob would have inherited only a fraction of his parents’ wealth,<img src="../../images/rarr.png" i="25"></p>
