I believe there are some very significant reasons these stories made it into our Holy Bible, even though the names of the individuals in them did not.</p>

      <p class="Body" i="19"><span class="char-style-override-17" i="20">1. They are included to show that every life, no matter how small, has significance to God.</span> Jesus knew the woman in this story, and He cared about her intimately whether or not anyone else there did. That is the case with us as well.</p>

They are included so that we can learn from the individuals’ struggles and triumphs.</span> This woman’s very public humiliation is part of history for all to read. But so is her very public redemption and the way Jesus loved her and treated her. Our own struggles, when redeemed by Christ, can become great gifts to others who learn from them.</p>

They are included to remind us that God is actually the main character in our stories, and it’s His name that should be lifted up, not ours.</span> One of the mistakes we often make is to believe that life is about us. Actually, this mistake is the root of all sin: placing ourselves at the center of the universe, where God belongs. We are all playing supporting roles in God’s story. He is bigger than any of our individual stories.</p>

Maybe their names are left out so that we can put our own names “in the blank,” so to speak, as we read their stories.</span> The anonymous stories of Scripture aren’t meant to be fairy tales for our entertainment; they are each meant to teach us something that we can apply to our own lives.</p>
